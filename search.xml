人的高贵在于灵魂人以内心世界的巨大差异分出高贵和平庸，乃至高贵和卑鄙。 高贵 - 珍惜内在的精神财富甚于外在的物质财富 在黑暗中并肩行走敬畏他人的精神本质 - 尊重他人的精神世界的神秘性 ，并给予爱和信任（而不是以理解别人为名义强迫别人袒露内心的一切，一旦遭到拒绝，便斥以缺乏信任） 精神生活的哲学生活的意义和价值 - 占有精神生活 苦难激发人已有的精神活力，使其在精神上收获。 灵魂的在场灵魂 - 普遍性的精神在个体的人身上的存在，或超越性的精神在人的日常生活中的存在。 最理想的工作是能体现一个人的灵魂的独特倾向的工作。 度闲的质量取决于灵魂所获得的愉悦。 每个人的灵魂教育都只能是自我教育。 不满足的人比满足的猪幸福易知足于物质世界但绝不满足于仅仅过物质生活的人的快乐更丰富。 人是有灵魂的灵魂很可能是人的有关生命的自我意识和精神表达。因此，一个有灵魂的人决不会只爱自己的生命，他必定能体悟众生一体、万有同源的道理。 追求在精神领域中的追求，目标即寓于过程中，无关世俗的成功，无关显示的姿态。 觉醒的灵魂对虚假的生活有敏锐的觉察和强烈的排斥。 真正的享受需要人的想象力给物添加精神价值。 怀念和追求构成我们的精神生活的基本内容。 精神危机源于执拗的精神追求和自我反省的勇气。 精神需求很高的人必须自己为自己创造精神的食物。 力量有限，追求被失败阻止；目标有限，追求被成功阻止。 真正的成熟，是独特个性的形成，真实自我的发现，精神上的结果和丰收。 人类精神生活的整体人类精神始终在追求某种永恒的价值，这种追求所形成的持久的精神事业和传统超越一切优秀个人的生死和世代延续。它本身就具有一种永恒的价值，甚至是人世间唯一可能和真实的永恒。 人类精神生活的土壤是统一的，并无学科之分。 （只要心性足够优秀，最深刻最高级的）精神生活可超国界。 第二辑 朝圣的心路与世界建立精神关系信仰的实质 - 与世界建立精神关系 人的物质活动、认知活动和社会活动仅是与周围环境的关系，而非与世界整体的关系。唯有人的信仰生活指向世界整体。 一个人（不甘心被世俗生活的浪潮推着走）总想为自己的生命确定一个具有恒久价值的目标，他便是一个有信仰生活的人。 作为信仰生活的支点的那个基本信念无须复杂，相反往往是简单的，但必须是真诚的。 精神生活的基础 - 真诚 敬畏生命，可以获得真诚。 朝圣的心路每个人正是靠自己的孤独的追求加入人类的精神传统的，而只要你的确走在自己的朝圣路上，你其实并不孤独。 人所能及的神圣人达成神圣的自然之道是肯定肉体及其欲望的合理性，前提是适当限制欲望。 人身上的神性是由动物性升华而来的。 所谓人性，是动物性向神性的升华。 人的神性基于对神圣价值的信仰。 信仰之光信仰是相信人生中有比自己的生命更重要的东西。 自己的信仰需要通过独立思考来寻求和确立。 思考信仰的问题最需要真诚（认真和诚实）的态度。 勇气证明信仰 《存在的勇气》 - 蒂利希 有明确的宗教信仰并不证明有勇气，相反，有精神追求的勇气却证明了有信仰 存在性焦虑 人是一种有限的存在（自身中始终包含着非存在） 焦虑 - 意识到非存在的威胁时的状态 一是非存在威胁人的本体上的存在，表现为对死亡和命运的焦虑（在古代末期占上风） 二是非存在威胁人的道德上的存在，表现为谴责和罪过的焦虑（在中世纪末期占上风） 三是非存在威胁人在精神上的存在，表现为对无意义和空虚的焦虑（在现代占主导地位） 存在的勇气就是自我不顾非存在的威胁而仍然肯定自己的存在。 存在本身不包含一丝一毫的非存在 唯有存在本身具备对抗非存在的绝对力量 接受无意义本身就是有意义的行为，这是一种信仰行为 - 信仰是灵魂的状态（而非头脑里的一种行为） 灵魂状态是最原初的信仰现象，一切宗教观念包括上帝观念都是由之派生的，是这个原初现象的辞不达意的自我表达。 尼采与现代人的精神危机 尼采 真诚的人如何在信仰沦丧的时代生活下去 真诚 - 在信仰问题上不苟且，不盲从，也不伪饰 真诚使人陷入悖论 真诚要求对人生追根究底，把生命的意义看得高于生命本身 对根据的无穷追究必然使任何终极根据站不住脚，生命的意义的丧失使生命本身成了问题 新的信仰 艺术拯救人生 日神精神 - 生活在美的外观中，爱生命的过程，而不去追究它的实质和归宿 酒神精神 早期 - 从个人的痛苦和毁灭中获得与宇宙生命本体相融合的悲剧性陶醉 后期 - 从生命的绝对无意义性中获得悲剧性陶醉：人生是幕悲剧，最大的悲剧就在于它的没有终极根据，但生命敢于承担自身的无意义而并不消沉衰落，这正是生命的骄傲！ 伦理失去了宗教的根据，可归入广义的功利。现代人实际上只能在艺术和功利二者间进行选择。 艺术的生存方式注重对生命的体验和灵魂愉悦 功利的生存方式注重对物质的占有和官能享乐 艺术为没有信仰的现代人提供了一种真正的精神补偿。 单纯的物质繁荣并不能使人真正幸福。 有所敬畏相信神圣的人有所敬畏（在其心中，总有一些东西属于做人的不可亵渎的根本）。 智慧和信仰 智慧 智慧的起点 - 看到并接受人所必有的限制 如果只有忍受，没有拯救，或者只有超脱，没有超越，智慧就会沦为冷漠的犬儒主义。可是，一旦寻求拯救和超越，智慧（不会仅止于智慧）必不可免地要走向信仰了。 真正的智慧中必蕴涵着信仰的倾向（哲学之所以必须是形而上学的道理之所在）。 哲学 没有或明或暗地包含着绝对价值的预设的哲学是值得怀疑的。 教义 如果有一种教义宣称能够在人世间消灭一切困境，实现完美，那它不是真正的信仰，在最好的情况下也只是乌托邦。 乌托邦 一切乌托邦的错误就在于企图篡改神的设定，其结果不是使人摆脱了限制而成为神，而一定是以神的名义施强制于人，把人的权利也剥夺了。 人的精神性自我的两种姿态 登高俯视尘世时看到限制的必然，产生达观的认识和超脱的心情 - 智慧 站在尘世仰望天空时，因永恒的缺陷而向往完美，因肉体的限制而寻求超越 - 信仰 信仰 完美不可一日而达到，超越永无止境，彼岸永远存在，如此信仰才得以延续。 信仰之路没有一个终于能够到达的目的地，但并非没目标，走在路上本身即是目标存在的证明，而是是唯一可能和唯一有效的证明。 上帝眼中无残疾上帝在我们真正发现了我们的完整的内在生命的地方。 （上帝眼中无残疾）每个人都能生活得高贵而伟大。 信仰 人是由两个途径走向上帝或某种宇宙精神的 给自己的灵魂生活找一个根源 - 康德所说的“道德律” 给宇宙的永恒存在寻找一个意义 - 康德所说的“头上的星空” 信仰是情感的事，理性不利于信仰。 宗教内部 虔信者 - 情感强烈理性薄弱（理想强烈情感薄弱的人无意做信徒） 怀疑者 - 情感和理性皆强（渴望信仰而不易得，精神上最痛苦） 盲从者 - 情感和理性皆弱（并无信仰，随大流） 自己寻找人生根本意义问题的答案的人超越了信仰。 现代人的精神处境有两个显著特点 虚无主义 - 信仰的普遍失落 物质主义 - 商业化潮流影响到生活方式、文化、人际关系各个方面 在信仰崩溃的时代，民族主义往往会抬头（大神死了，人们便寻求小神祇的庇护）。 宗教无论何人，只要执意在短暂的人生中求永生，在人生的不完善中求完善，他便已经具有一种宗教倾向了。 宗教是理想主义的极致，理想主义者所相信的绝对精神价值是神的同义语。 宗教精神的实质 - 对个人内在心灵生活比外在生活更重视（一个人是否具有这种广义的宗教精神，与他是否是宗教徒或属于什么教派无关） 在现代社会中，凡企图把任何一种新福音强加给社会的教派，必然成为邪教。 不管是否幸运，每个人独自担当拯救自己灵魂的责任，将是许多代人的命运。 神秘 - 人的心智不能达到的领域 神圣 - 不可亵渎的价值 宗教的本质不在信神，而在面对神秘的谦卑（有无神之分）和面对神圣的敬畏（有无信仰之分）。 第三辑 梦并不虚幻梦并不虚幻对看不见的东西的梦想驱使我们去寻找、去追求，在看得见的事物里发现隐秘的意义，从而觉得我们周围的世界无比美丽。 好梦何必成真 两种梦 物质的梦 - （弗洛伊德）未实现的愿望的替代 精神的梦，其范围和含义包括组成一个人的心灵生活的东西（生命的感悟，艺术的体验，哲学的沉思，宗教的信仰等） 真·善·美 柏拉图对真善美的解释 人的心灵分三部分 理智 意志 情感 真 - 理智的对象，体现为科学活动 善 - 意志的对象，体现为道德活动 美 - 情感的对象，体现为艺术活动 真 - 真理、真实、事物的真相 热爱真理 怀疑 - 真正热爱真理的人必定具有怀疑精神，对真理的热忱追求往往表现为对传统观念和流行意见的怀疑乃至反抗 敢于坚持 - 在人类历史上，新发现的真理一开始总被视为异端，遭到统治者乃至全社会的反对和迫害，因而坚持真理必须具有非凡的勇气和牺牲精神 善 - 牵涉到理想和价值标准的问题 个人的善 - 个人道德上、人格上、精神上的提高和完善 社会的善 - 社会的进步和公正 美 美感的实质 - 精神性的愉悦（美感的发生有赖于感官，但若未能使心灵愉悦，则不美） 真、善、美是不可分的。理智上求真，意志上向善，情感上爱美，三者原是一体，属于同一颗高贵心灵的追求，是从不同角度来描述同一种高尚的精神生活。 度一个创造的人生人类精神生活的特征 - 创造 决定一种活动是否具有创造性的关键在于有无灵魂的真正参与。 真正的创造是不计结果的（它是一个人的内在力量的自然而然的实现，本身即是享受）。 听从自己活泼敏锐的心灵的吩咐，去做能真正使它快乐的事，不论结果，都会获得一个有意义的创造的人生。 哲学、时代与理想主义衡量任何精神作品，第一标准是看它的精神内涵，包括深度、广度、创新等等（而不是看它是否容易被读懂-是否通俗）。 道德败坏是种蒙昧，与文化水平无关。 理想应是指值得追求的精神价值（如作为社会理想的正义，作为人生理想的真善美等）。 让世界适合于小王子们居住《小王子》中心思想 - 凭真性情直接生活在本质中（而不要像许多成人那样为权力、虚荣、占有、职守、学问之类表面的东西无事空忙） 一个真诚的理想主义者治学的目的 - 自身的精神完善（“古之学者为己” - 孔子） 理想主义(idealism)有二义 与实利主义(materialism)相对立，指注重精神生活达到价值，视精神生活的满足为人生真正幸福所在 与虚无主义(nihilism)相对立，指信仰某种绝对价值（这种信仰与宗教学说无必然联系） 中庸 - 守住理想，以理想为“最终标准”，同时方便变通，应用理想于实际（守经而达权） 哲学家或中蛊者部分人狂热相信自己发现了绝对真理，对人类思想史一无所知或所知极少，念头一旦固结在某个命题上，就不再转移，从此就为社会承认这个命题以及自己的创始人地位而徒劳努力。或通过拓宽知识视野治愈。 理想主义 两种理想 社会理想，旨在救世和社会改造（有待商榷是否切合社会实际） 人生理想，旨在自救和个人完美，（无不切实际的说法）仅关涉个人的灵魂，在任何社会条件下总可追求智慧和美德 理想的作用 - 安放灵魂生活 心灵也是一种现实世界的丰富的美是依每个人心灵丰富的程度而开放的。 肉体需要有极限，超与此上的都是精神需要。 内在的精神素质把人分出了伟大和渺小，优秀和平庸。 善报恶报之别并非止步于世俗祸福，还有因人的内在精神品质的差异从相同的外在遭遇中获得的迥然不同的意义（善者的善使苦难具有一种证实、洗礼、净化的精神价值（收获精神果实），恶者因其恶使苦难具有一种诅咒、浩劫、毁灭的惩罚性质）。 梦在人生中的价值梦（并不虚幻）对人心的作用和在人生中的价值是真实的。 弱者梦想现实中有但他无力得到的东西，并以之抚慰生存的失败；智者梦想现实中没有也不可能有的东西，并以之解说生存的意义。 创造生活质量的三要素：一、创造；二、享受；三、体验。 创造是用生命去交换比生命更长久的东西。 - 圣爱克苏佩里 创造者与非创造者的区别 前者创造自己用不上的财富（生命的意义所寄托之处） 后者用生命交换维持生命的东西，仅生产自己直接或间接用得上的财富 伟大的精神（哲学、文学、艺术）创造者的两个显著特点 具有内在的一贯性（其所有作品是一个整体） 具有挑战性（不但挑战外界，而且挑战自己，不断突破和超越自己，不断在自己的问题方向上寻找新的解决） 精神创造领域内的事情是个人独立完成的（不可能有真正的合作，充其量只能有交流）。 创造者晚年的悲哀 精神蓬勃，肉体衰老 心灵枯寂（精神财富失去意义） 天才天才有非说不可的自己的话。 天才区别于常人的（不是智力和勤奋）是一种使命感-对自己生命的责任心。 天才属于有与无，最小与最大，自我与永恒（生活在观念和想象的世界）。 天才的勤奋（不是勉为其难的机械的劳作）是能量的不可遏制的释放（有严格的工作习惯）。 不能养成工作的习惯是才华不足的证明，创造欲是才华最重要的组成部分。 天才不知自己之长。 天才骨子里都有一点自卑（成功的强者内心深处往往埋着一段屈辱的经历）。 创造靠智慧，处世靠常识。有常识而无智慧，谓之平庸。有智慧而无常识，谓之笨拙。 天才三境界：入世随俗，避世隐居，救世献身。 关于天才如何被承认的假说 其一，级差承认（低等才智承认高等才智），使天才获得声誉，其代价是误解的递增 其二，连锁承认（被承认的天才所欣赏的天才也被承认） 其三，（最准确的说法也许是）通过被误解而得到承认 天才因其被误解而成其伟大 第一，被误解的程度和独特伟大的程度往往成正比 第二，人们对天才的接受基于普遍误解所改造的天才形象 第三，天才的丰富性和神秘性激发人们猜测他从而误解他的兴趣，伟大和可误解度成正比 也许，天才最好的命运是留下著作。 天才在成功后厌倦。 天才独一无二、不可重复。 精神现象人生境界的三项指标：生活情趣，文化品位，精神视野。 人之间的区别全在感觉（高下、精粗、深浅、厚薄之不同）。 成熟 - 适应社会现成准则的能力 一个人如果过于专注于精神世界里的探索，就会没有兴趣和精力琢磨如何使自己适应社会。年龄的增长无济于事，因为精神的探索永无止境，而且在这条道路上走得越远的人，就越不可能回过头来补习处世的基础课程。 （两种不同的复杂）精神上的丰富和品性上的腐败不可并存于同一个人。 对真善美的强烈的追求不能不发生冲突（三者都弱，才能相安无事）。 一切复活在回忆中，一切超越在想象中。 第四辑 守望的距离守望的距离守望者 - 守护精神园地，珍藏人类最基本的精神价值，了望人类前方的地平线，注视人类精神生活的基本走向 守望者的职责“守望者”的职责 - 与时代潮流保持适当的距离，守护人生的永恒的价值，了望和关心人类精神生活的基本走向 第一重要的是做人一个人真正能支配的唯有对一切外在遭际的态度，简言之，就是如何做人。 人不只属于历史“反抗”在本质上是肯定某种价值，其中隐含着危险-把所要捍卫的价值绝对化。 任何历史举动都是冒险，无权为任何绝对立场辩护。绝对理性主义如同虚无主义一样，会把人类引向荒漠。 - 加缪 一个人未必要充当某种历史角色才活得有意义，最好的生活方式是贴近自然的和生命本身的生活。 善良·丰富·高贵 善良 - 生命对生命的同情 （中外哲人都认为）同情是人与兽的区别的开端，是人类全部道德的基础 善良是区分好人与坏人的最初界限，也是最后的界限 丰富 - 人的精神能力的生长、开花和结果 （中外哲人都认为）丰富的心灵是幸福的真正源泉，精神的快乐远远高于肉体的快乐 高贵 - 尊重人（自己和他人） （中外哲人都认为）人要有做人的尊严，要有做人的基本原则（如果违背，就意味着不把自己当人） 特点 - 极其尊重他人 “已所欲，勿施于人”尊重他人的独立人格和精神自由 报应一切最高的奖励和惩罚（不是外加的）是行为本身给行为者造成的精神后果。 何尝失落真正爱文化者所爱的文化既不会成为一种时髦，也不会随市场行情低落。 守护人类最基本精神价值的智者不会（因世俗对其的冷落）有失落感。 如果一个人知道自己的志向所在并一如既往地从事这一志业，如果他在此过程中感觉到了自己的生命意义与历史责任的某种统一，那么，他在精神上是充实自足的。 救世和自救 精神生活的普遍平庸化 一、信仰生活的失落（缺乏精神目标，既无传统的支持，又无理想的引导） 二、情感生活的缩减（畸形都市化堵塞人与自然的交感，功利意识扩张导致人之间的真情淡薄，情感体验失去个性和实质） 三、文化生活的粗鄙（诉诸官能的大众消费文化泛滥，诉诸心灵的严肃文化陷入困境） 对精神生活平庸化现象持否定态度的人有两种 一类人，具有强烈的社会责任感，反应因性情和观念的差异而有区别（宗教和道德型-愤怒；理智型-忧虑） 立场 - 救世（重建精神生活的秩序） 另一类人，比较个人化的知识分子，没有太直接的用世抱负，更关注自己独立的精神探索和文化创造活动，反应主要是近乎宽容的淡薄和蔑视 立场 - 自救（始终与俗世保持距离，把精神上的独立追求和自我完善视为人生在世的安身立命之本） （至少在精神生活领域内）自救是更为切实的救世之道。 真正精神性的东西是完全独立于时代的，它植根于人类与大地的某种永恒关系之中。只要这种关系存在，人类精神生活作为一个整体决不会中断，而个人看来似乎孤独的精神旅程便属于这个整体，没有力量能使之泯灭。 坚守精神的家园对于我们的行为，我们不能只用交换价值来衡量，而应有更加开阔久远的参照系。 在投入现代潮流的同事，我们要坚守那些永恒的人生价值。 人的家基于有相同渴望的人之间的联系。 高贵者的道德人生意义取决于灵魂生活的状况。其中，世俗意义即幸福取决于灵魂的丰富，神圣意义即德性取决于灵魂的高贵。 （康德说）人是目的（不可被当作手段）。 大智者必谦和，大善者必宽容。唯有小智者才咄咄逼人，小善者才斤斤计较。 大气象者，不讲排场；讲大排场者，露小气象。 大骄傲往往谦逊平和，只有小骄傲才傲慢。 有巨大优越感的人，必定也有包容万物、宽待众生的胸怀。 骄傲和谦卑未必是反义词，真正的对立存在于高贵与低贱之间。 道德现象 道德的两种含义 精神性的，旨在追求个人完善（此种追求若赋予神圣的名义，便进入宗教领域） 实用性的，旨在维护社会秩序（此种维护若辅以暴力的手段，便进入法律领域） 两者不可混淆 建立某种社会秩序来强制实现个人完善 -&gt; 专制主义 把社会秩序的取舍完全交付个人良心来决定 -&gt; 无政府主义 做人讲道德是为了对得起自己的良心，做事讲效率是为了对得起自己的生命。 论平庸和伪善虚伪是冒充高尚的自觉的庸俗。 对自己的生命不负责任，就无严肃可言，平庸就是最大的不严肃。 群体性懒惰是阻碍个性发展的最大阻力（在社会中，每个人个性的自由发展意味着竞争，于是，为了自己能偷懒，就嫉恨他人的优秀，宁愿人人都保持在平庸的水平上）。 个人越是雷同，社会越是少凝聚力。无个性的个体不能结合为整体。个人越是独特，个性的差异越是鲜明，由这样的个体组成的社会有机体就越是生气勃勃。 一个真实的人，一种独特的个性，必有突出的优缺点，袒露在人们面前，并不加道德的伪饰，而这正是他的道德。 人品和智慧虚伪、凶恶、丑陋 -&gt; 贪欲 -&gt; 无明（没有智慧，对人生缺乏透彻的认识） 真正决定道德素养的是人生智慧（而非意识形态）。通过强化意识形态来整饬世风人心是肤浅的。 意识形态属于头脑，人生智慧属于心灵。人与人之间能否默契，取决于人生智慧的相通。 社会愈文明，意识形态愈淡化，人生智慧的作用就愈突出，人之间的关系也就愈真实自然。 人生与道德、做人与处世、精神追求与社会关切之间有着内在的联系。如果要在两者间找一个结合点，伦理学无疑最具备此种资格。伦理学的内容应该拓宽，把人生哲学的基本原理也包括进去，不能局限于道德学说。 人品不仅有好坏优劣之分，而且有高低宽窄之分，后者与才分有关（有德无才者之善多为小善，有才无德者之恶多为大恶）。 知识是工具，无所谓善恶，可以用来为善或为恶。美德与知识的关系不大。美德的真正源泉是智慧（一种开阔的人生觉悟）。 德行（如果不是从智慧流出）单凭修养造就，便至少是盲目的，很可能是功利和伪善的。 人品和才智都可以改变，但要是有大的改变都很难。 第五辑 孤岛断想灵魂只能独行世间最动人的爱仅是两颗独行的灵魂间的最深切的呼唤和应答。 灵魂行走只有一个目标，就是寻找上帝。灵魂之所以只能独行，是因为每一个人只有自己寻找，才能找到他的上帝。 内在的眼睛内在的眼睛看见意义。 内在的眼睛不使用会退化，常练习就能敏锐。 灵魂之杯每个人的灵魂之杯的容量很可能是确定的，在一切情形下，都不会超载（每个人所分配到的容量恰好是他必须付出毕生努力才能够装满的）。 精神之树的果实创造的精神价值的伟大与否主要取决于个人。 灵魂的亲缘关系在读好书时，灵魂在精神世界并不孤独。 小爱和大爱尘躯的小爱检验一个人的心灵力度。 遁入空门，禁绝一切生命的欲念，藉此而达于对死亡无动于衷不算彻悟。真正的彻悟是在恋生的同时不畏死，始终怀着小爱，在最后时刻仍能从容面对生死的诀别。 偶然性的价值我所爱的既定事实无所谓偶然性。 尘世遭遇的意义人看清一切人间遭遇的偶然性和有限性便会产生一种超脱的心情。 每个人的尘世遭遇对其自己有特殊的重要性（在黑暗中绊倒人的物体也给人支撑）。 部分尘世遭遇具有精神意义（助人领悟）。 死亡不是一个思考的对象当我们自以为在思考死亡的时候，实际上所做的事情（不是思考）是别的，例如期望、相信、假设、想象、类比等等。 我们不能根据已知的现世生命状态衡量死后。 对死亡的真正思考是不可能的，我们除了用类比或其它诗意的解说来鼓励自己之外，无能为力。 生活的减法用来日不多的标准来限定必做的事情，从而为享受生活留出更多的自由时间。 心灵的空间未被占据的空间和时间具有最高价值。 保留一个开阔的心灵空间（一种内在的从容和悠闲），才能获得快乐和自由（生命的果实）。 丰富的单纯对于心的境界的最高赞语 - 丰富的单纯，其核心始终是单纯的，又能包容丰富的情感、体验和思想。 每一个精神上的伟人在本质上都是直面宇宙的。一方面，他知道自己只是宇宙的儿童（这种认识深藏于他的心灵的核心中），从根本上使他的心灵永葆儿童的单纯。另一方面，他对宇宙的永恒本质充满精神渴望，在这种渴望的支配下，他本能地受一切精神事物所吸引，使他的心灵变得越来越丰富。 贫乏的复杂 - 平庸；贫乏的单纯 - 简单；丰富的复杂 - 魔鬼的心。 自然、社会与人性的单纯 人性的单纯来自自然（两种） 原始的单纯 - 原始的物质性的自然 超越的单纯 - 超越的精神性的自然 在两种自然间，在人性的两种单纯间，隔着社会和社会关系。社会的作用一方面使人脱离了原始的自然，另一方面又会阻止人走向超越的自然。 社会是一个使人性复杂化的领域。没有人能够完全脱离社会而生活。但是，也没有人必须为了社会放弃自己的心灵生活。对于那些精神本能强烈的人来说，节制社会交往和简化社会关系是自然而然的事情。正因为如此，他们才能够越过社会的壁障而走向伟大的精神目标。 道路与家人生既是道路（将死看作一种更高的生，让心灵有超越的追求），又是家（让心灵得到休息）。 信仰的价值任何一种外在精神实体的信仰都是虚假的，其价值在于把人引向内心，过一种内在的精神生活。 一个人的信仰之真假，分界也在于有没有内在的精神生活。 第六辑 读《圣经》札记不可发誓一个人面对他的上帝时，他只需说真话，超出于此，他就（不是在对上帝说话）对别的什么说话，例如对权力、舆论或市场。 有真信仰的人满足于说出真话，喜欢发誓的人往往并无真信仰。 发誓者竭力揣摩对方的心思，他发誓要做的不是自己真正想做的事情，而是他以为对方希望自己做的事情。如果他揣摩的是地上的人的心思，那是卑怯。如果他揣摩的是天上的神的心思，那就是亵渎了。 一个人说了真话，他仍然可能发誓，他把别人的相信和重视看得比说真话本身更重要，仿佛说真话的价值取决于别人是否相信和重视似的。因此，如果得不到预期的结果，他就随时可能放弃说真话。 一个直面上帝的人无论对谁说话，都同时是在对上帝说话，上帝听见了他说的真话，他就问心无愧了。 恨是狭隘，爱是超越不受狭隘的本能和习俗的支配，爱宇宙间的一切生灵。 天上的财宝物质的财宝不可靠，精神的财宝可靠，应该为自己积累可靠的财宝。 当你为自己积累财宝在天上时，你的心已经在天上；当你的灵魂富有时，你的灵魂已经得救了。 伺候哪一个主人一个人的人生目标只能定位在一个方向上，或者追求精神上的伟大、高贵、超越，或者追逐世俗的的利益，不可能同时走在两个方向上。 判断一个人是金钱的奴隶还是金钱的主人，（不能看他有没有钱）要看他对金钱的态度。 一个穷人必须为生存而操心，金钱对他意味着活命，我们无权评判他对金钱的态度。 在物质生活上应当顺其自然，满足于自然所提供的简朴条件，如此才能专注于精神的事业。 行淫的女人在任何专制体制下，都必然盛行严酷的道德法庭，其职责便是以道德的名义把人性当做罪恶来审判。事实上，用这样的尺度衡量，每个人都是有罪的，至少都是潜在的罪人。 道德审判激起人们疯狂的热情，其心理可能是这样的 一方面，有人做了自己想做而不敢做的事情，嫉妒化装成正义的愤怒喷发 另一方面，倘若自己做了类似的事，坚决向法庭人认同，与罪人划清界线，就成了一种自我保护的本能反应，仿佛谴责的调门越高，自己越是安全 精神领域里的嫉妒在精神领域里，包括宗教信仰、思想探索、艺术创造等等，资格是完全不起作用的。倘若有人因为资格老而嫉妒后来者的成就，那么他越是嫉妒，就越是表现他在精神上的低下，他的地位就是越要居后。 本乡人眼里无先知 本乡人眼里无先知的原因 把他人看作自己所熟悉的他人的外部特征的总和（认识肤浅） 由于生活环境相同，以己度人（先入为主） 嫉妒（相同环境下生长的人的优秀让自己觉得遭到贬低）（直到很久后，后人出于同样的虚荣心，把先知的诞生当做本乡的光荣大加宣扬） 一切精神上的伟人之所以伟大，是因为他们（从来不属于本乡）以全民族或全人类为自己的舞台。其光荣只属于民族或人类。 地方间为伟人出生地发生的争执是可笑的，常常还是可耻的，因为它们常常带着借死去的伟人牟利的卑鄙意图。 奥秘和比喻存在的一切奥秘都是用比喻说出来的。对于听得懂的耳朵，大海、星辰、季节、野花、婴儿都在说话，而听不懂的耳朵却什么也没有听到。所以，富者越来越富，贫者越来越贫，是精神王国里的必然法则。 一天的难处一天担当 远虑是无穷尽的，必须适可而止 有些远虑可预见也可预作筹划，不妨就预作筹划，以解除近忧 有些忧虑可预见但无法预作筹划，那就暂且搁下，不必让它提前成为近忧 有些忧虑，完全不能预见，不必总怀着莫名之忧折磨自己 总之，尽量少往自己的心里搁忧虑，保持轻松和光明的心境 一天的难处一天担当，这样人不但轻松，而且较容易把难处解决。 舆论的不宽容舆论的敌人是思想，它（从不正面与思想交锋），总是把对手抓到自己的庸俗法庭上，用自己的庸俗法律将其定罪。 - 舆论将关于思想的解释权归于自己所有 小孩、富人和天国把身外之物看得比精神价值更宝贵，不肯舍弃的人难以进入天国。 狂妄者最无信仰如果说，认识到人的无知是智慧的起点，那么，觉悟到人的不完美是信仰的起点。所谓信仰，其实就是不完美者对于完美境界的永远憧憬和追求。 狂妄（有了一点知识便自以为无所不知，做了一点善事便自以为有权审判天下人）离智慧和虔诚最远。 不见而信在物质事实的领域内，“眼见为实”这个标准基本上成立的。间接经验以直接经验为基础（我们对于自己未见的事实的相信，终归是以自己亲见的事实为基础）。 在精神价值的领域内，“眼见为实”的标准就完全不适用了。理想，信仰，真理，爱，善，这些精神价值（永远不可见）实现的场所只能是人的内心世界。人的内心有无信仰，这个差异必定会在外在行为中表现出来。但是，差异的根源是在内心，正是在这无形之域，有的人生活在光明中，有的人生活在黑暗中。 不见而信（钟爱精神价值本身而不要求看见其实际效果）是信仰的前提。 拒绝光即已是惩罚光，真理，善，一切美好的价值，它们的存在是为了造福于人（使人感到生而为人的幸运）。 不可试探你的上帝人类的一些最基本的价值，例如正义、自由、和平、爱、诚信，是不能用经验来证明和证伪的。它们本身就是目的（人类所追求的），我们不可用它们会带来什么实际的好处评价它们，更不可用违背它们会造成什么具体的恶果检验它们。 信仰要求的是纯粹，只为所信仰的真理本身而不为别的什么。凡试探者，必定别有所图。 不仅是靠食物信仰的实质在于对精神价值本身的尊重。 信仰愈是纯粹，愈是尊重精神价值本身，必然就愈能摆脱一切民族的、教别的、宗派的狭隘眼光，呈现出博大的气象。 信仰问题上的任何狭隘性，其根源都在于利益的侵入，取代和扰乱了真正的精神追求。 人类的信仰生活永远不可能统一于某一种宗教，而只能统一于对某些基本价值的广泛尊重。 神圣的休息日只有劳作，没有闲暇，人会丧失性灵，忘掉人生之根本。 安息日是为人而设的人世间的一切规则，都应以人为本，都可依据人的合理需要加以变通。有些规则不许更改，例如自由、公正、法治、人权，因为它们体现了一切个人的根本利益和人类的基本价值理想。说到底，正是为了遵循这些最一般的规则，才有了不断修正与之不合的具体规则的必要，而这就是人类走向幸福的必由之路。 种子和土壤信仰的种子唯有在好的心灵土壤中才能成功地生长。 对于一个心灵麻木的人来说，一切神圣的启示和伟大的创造都等于不存在。 不论时代怎样，一个人都可以获得精神生长的必要资源，因为只要你的心灵土壤足够肥沃，那些神圣和伟大的种子对于你就始终是存在着的。 一个人的精神疆土的极限，心灵土质的特异类型，很可能是由天赋的因素决定的，但是心灵土壤的肥瘠不会是天生的，我们每个人都应留心开垦自己的心灵土壤。 不要把珍珠扔给猪 一个人倘若崇敬神圣的东西，怎么会把它丢给邪恶或愚昧之人？（两种可能） 太轻信，看不清邪恶者和愚昧者的真面目 太自信，认定真理的力量足以立刻感化邪恶者，启迪愚昧者 虔诚不是目的凡真正的信仰，其核心必是一种内在的觉醒，是灵魂对肉身生活的超越以及对最高精神价值的追寻和领悟。 虔诚是面对神圣之物的一种恭敬谦卑的态度，其本身（不是信仰）只是信仰的一个表征。真正的信仰应是对神圣之物有所领悟。 凡是把虔诚当作目的和目标来标榜的人，大多是伪善的。 - 歌德` 耶稣的命运邪恶者根本不知真理为何物，更不懂得反对和仇恨真理，只不过出于自己极狭隘的私利对他人下毒手（谈不上是真理的敌人）。 第七辑 幸福和苦难幸福是灵魂的事幸福不是纯粹客观的状态，主要是一种内心非常强烈和深刻的快乐的状态。 人的生活可分三部分 肉体生活，饮食男女 社会生活，包括在社会上做事以及与他人的交往 灵魂生活 - 心灵对生命意义的沉思和体验 (一切美好的经历必须转化为内心的体验才成其为幸福）内心体验的敏感和丰富与否决定了一个人感受幸福的能力。 快感离幸福有多远（许多哲学家都谈到）人的需要是有层次之分，越是精神性的需要居于越高的层次（所谓高低不是从道德是讲的，不能以道德的名义否定肉体的快感）。 （英国哲学家约翰·穆勒说）凡是体验过两种快乐的人就会知道，精神的快乐更加强烈也更加丰富。所以，肉体的快乐只是起点，如果停留于此，沉湎于此，局限于此，实际上是蒙受了自己所不知的巨大损失，把自己的人生限制在了一个可怜的范围内。 达到幸福的境界必须有灵魂的参与。 纯粹肉体性质的快感是十分有限的，差不多也是比较雷同的，情感的投入才使得快感变得独特而丰富。 可持续的快乐青春首要是快乐，其次是将快乐可持续化（为今后考虑）。 快乐不应单一短暂，完全依赖外部条件，而应丰富持久，能靠自己创造（否则结果仍不快乐）。 苦难的精神价值对意义的寻求是人的最基本的需要。当这种需要找不到明确的指向时，人就会感到空虚(弗兰克称为“存在的空虚”）。 寻求生命意义的途径 第一，创造，以实现内在的精神能力和生命的价值 第二，体验，藉爱情、友谊、沉思、对大自然和艺术的欣赏等等美好经历获得心灵的愉悦 第三，肯定苦难本身在人生中的意义 倘若一个人落入了某种不幸境遇，基本上失去了积极创造和正面体验的可能，他的生命是否还有一种意义？ 第一，人生中有一种可以称做绝境的境遇，所遭遇的苦难是致命的，或者永久性的，人不复有未来，不复有希望。如果苦难本身毫无价值，则一旦陷入此种境遇，我们就只好承认生活没有任何意义。 第二，不论苦难是否暂时的，如果把眼前的苦难生活仅仅当做虚幻不实的生活，就会忽略苦难本身所提供的机会。 即使处在最恶劣的境遇中，人仍然拥有一种不可剥夺的精神自由，即可以选择承受苦难的方式。 - 弗兰克 面对苦难苦难提高人的认识 - 厄运打断我们所习惯的生活，同时提供一个机会，迫使我们与外界事物拉开一个距离，回到自己。只要我们善于利用这个机会，肯于思考，就会对人生获得一种新眼光。 苦难提高人的人格。 - 不论遭受怎样的苦难，只要他始终警觉着他拥有采取何种态度的自由，并勉励自己以一种坚忍高贵的态度承受苦难，他就比任何时候都更加有效地提高着自己的人格。 凡苦难都会让人不可挽回地丧失某种重要的价值，但同时人生存在着别的一些价值鼓舞着受苦者承受眼前的苦难。 在毁灭一切价值的苦难中，如果说承受苦难仍有意义，那么，这意义几乎唯一地就在于承受苦难的方式本身了。 以尊严的方式承受苦难，这是一项实实在在的内在成就，因为它证明了人在任何时候都拥有不可剥夺的精神自由。 - 弗兰克 我们每个人都终归要面对一个没有任何前途的苦难-死亡，而以尊严的方式承受死亡的确是我们精神生活的最后一项伟大的成就。 麻木比瘟疫更可怕只要身处祸害中，我们也许找不到办法来摆脱一种不幸-习惯于绝望的处境，与任何共同祸害的斗争都具有战争的性质，牺牲个性是其不得不付出的代价。 麻木（瘟疫之后生活照旧）比瘟疫（为了不让它们蔓延开，我们必须改变自己的生活方式）更可怕。 幸福幸福是种能力（使内心世界足够丰富敏感和活跃来感受幸福）。 苦与乐的数量取决于人的遭遇，苦与乐的品质取决于人的灵魂。 生活乐趣的大小取决于你对生活的关心程度（用心品味生活中的细节和场景）。 人生有两个幸福 做自己做的事，满足自己 给自己喜欢的人带来快乐 幸福只存在于相信它的人心中。 幸福是有限的。 幸福（是一个抽象概念）不是一个事实。 幸福是一种苟且，不愿苟且者不可能幸福。我们的自由仅存于以何种方式接受。 一切灾祸都有一个微小的起因，一切幸福都有一个平庸的结尾。 自己未曾找到伟大的幸福的人，无权要求别人拒绝平凡的幸福。自己已经找到伟大的幸福的人，无意要求别人拒绝平凡的幸福。 寻常的苦难人类个体间痛苦的不相通也许正是人类总体仍然快乐的前提。那么，一个人的灾难对于亲近的和不亲近的人们的生活几乎不发生任何影响，这就对了。 幸运者对别人的不幸或同情或隔膜，但比两者更强烈的也许是侥幸；不幸者对别人的幸运或委屈或冷淡，但比两者更强烈的也许是委屈。 同病相怜的实质未必是不幸者的彼此同情，而更是不幸者各以他人的不幸为自己的安慰，亦即幸灾乐祸。 人们对苦难的感受的三个阶段：事前不敢想象，到时必须忍受，过后不堪回首。 痛苦使人深刻，但是，如果生活中没有欢乐，深刻就容易走向冷酷。未经欢乐滋润的心灵太硬，它缺乏爱和宽容。 平凡性是真正的悲剧的本质，诗意的美化必然导致扭曲。 人天生是软弱的，唯其软弱而犹能承担起苦难，才显出人的尊严。 面对社会悲剧，我们有理想、信念、正义感、崇高感支撑自己，哪怕眼前观众全都浑浑噩噩，是非颠倒，我们仍有勇气把戏演给我们心目中绝对清晰公正的观众看，我们称这观众为历史、上帝或良心。 也许，（面对自然悲剧）没有浪漫气息的悲剧是我们最本质的悲剧，不具英雄色彩的勇气是我们最真实的勇气。我们不肯倒下以此维护人的最高的也是最后的尊严——一人在大自然（=神=虚无）面前的尊严。 面对无可逃避的厄运和死亡，绝望的人在失去一切慰藉后，总还有一个慰藉，便是在勇敢承受命运时的尊严感。由于降灾于我们的，是大自然本身，因此在我们的勇敢中体现出的乃是人的最高尊严——人在神面前的尊严。 面对苦难，我们可以用艺术、哲学、宗教的方式寻求安慰 共同点 在想象中把自我从正在受苦的肉身凡胎分离出来，立足于一个安全的位置上，居高临下地看待苦难 艺术 苦难只是体验，是我所写的人生这部作品的素材，无论作品的某些章节多么悲惨，我依然故我 哲学 在我无边广阔的视野里，苦难稍纵即逝，微不足道，不值得为之动心 宗教 肉体卑贱，注定受苦，而我将升入天国，永享福乐 如同肉体的痛苦一样，精神的痛苦也是无法分担的。别人的关爱至多只能转移你对痛苦的注意力，却不能改变痛苦的实质。 我们对于别人的痛苦的耐心（同情会消退）远远不如对于别人的罪恶的耐心。一个我们不得不忍受的别人的罪恶仿佛是命运，一个我们不得不忍受的别人的痛苦却几乎是罪恶了。 当你遭受巨大痛苦时，你要自爱，懂得自己忍受，尽量不用你的痛苦去搅扰别人。 人得救靠本能人生的重大苦难都起于关系，对付它的方法之一便是有意识地置身在关系之外，和自己的遭遇拉开距离（例如从关系和生命的纯粹偶然性中获得类似解脱的心境）。 同灾难拉开一个心理距离，可以有种种方法 乐观者 —— 看到灾难的暂时性，怀抱希望 悲观者 —— 把灾难放在人生虚无的大背景下来看，看破人间祸福的无谓从而产生一种超脱的心境 普通人 ——尽量把注意力放在生活中尚存的别的快乐上 实质 —— 逃避（逃避常常是必要的） 如果我们骄傲得不肯逃避，或沉重得不能逃避，剩下的唯一办法就是忍。我们终于发现，忍受不可忍受的灾难是人类的命运。接着我们又发现，只要咬牙忍受，世上并无不可忍受的灾难。 所谓超脱，不过是寻找一种精神上的支撑，从而较能忍，并非不需要忍了。 忍不了的时候结果是肉体的崩溃——死亡，精神的崩溃——疯狂，最糟则是人格的崩溃——从此萎靡不振。 忍是一种自救，即使自救不了，至少也是一种自尊。以从容平静的态度忍受人生最悲惨的厄运，这是处世做人的基本功夫。 人是注定要忍受不可忍受的苦难的。所以，世上没有不可忍受的苦难。 面对死亡，最好的哲学解释也至多只能解除我们对于恐惧的恐惧，而不能解除恐惧本身（后一层恐惧属于本能），我们只能带着它接受宿命。 着眼于过程，人生才有幸福或痛苦可言。以死为背景，一切苦乐祸福的区别就无谓了。因此，当我们身在福中时，我们尽量不去想死的背景，以免败坏眼前的幸福。一旦苦难临头，我们又尽量去想死的背景，以求超脱当下的苦难。 人得救靠本能，各种哲学和宗教的安慰无非是人类生存本能的自勉罢了。 悲观主义者用终极的虚无淡化日常的苦难，用彻底的悲观淡化尘世的哀伤，但他们的彻底仅是理论上的，在现实生活中，生存本能仍然驱使他们不断受小小的希望鼓舞，从而能忍受这遭到他们否定的人生。 “好了伤疤忘了疼”，是人的自卫本能。记住苦难带来的疼痛，人类早就失去了生存的兴趣和勇气。人类是在忘却中前进的。 许多时候人需要遗忘，有时候人还需要装作自己已经遗忘。 苦难与人的素质对于沉溺于眼前琐屑享受的人，不足与言真正的欢乐。对于沉溺于眼前琐屑烦恼的人，不足与言真正的痛苦。 人有素质的差异。苦难可激发生机，也可扼杀生机；可磨练意志，也可摧垮意志；可启迪智慧，也可蒙蔽智慧；可高扬人格，也可贬抑人格，全看受苦者的素质如何。素质大致规定了一个人承受苦难的限度，在此限度内，苦难的锤炼或可助人成材，超出此则会把人击碎。 痛苦是性格的催化剂，它使强者更强，弱者更弱，暴者更暴，柔者更柔，智者更智，愚者更愚。 在多数情况下，同情伤害了痛苦者的自尊。如果他是强者，你把他当弱者来同情，是一种伤害。如果他是弱者，你的同情只会使他更不求自强，也是一种伤害。 佛的智慧把爱当作痛苦的根源而加以弃绝，扼杀生命的意志。我的智慧把痛苦当做爱的必然结果而加以接受，化为生命的财富。 任何智慧都不能使我免于痛苦，我只愿有一种智慧足以使我不毁于痛苦。 一种西方的哲学教导我们趋乐避苦。一种东方的宗教教导我们摆脱苦与乐的轮回。可是，真正热爱人生的人把痛苦和快乐一齐接受下来。 在视人生感受为最宝贵财富的人眼里，命运的打击因心灵的收获而得到了补偿。 快感和痛感是肉体感觉，快乐和痛苦是心理现象，而幸福和苦难则仅属于灵魂（叹息和歌唱，或呻吟和抗议）。 幸福是生命意义得到实现的鲜明感觉。人在苦难中也可感觉到生命意义的实现乃至最高的实现，因此苦难与幸福未必是相互排斥的。但是在多数情况下，人们在苦难中感觉到的却是生命意义的受挫。即使是这样，只要没被苦难彻底击败，苦难仍会深化一个人对于生命意义的认识。 第八辑 智者的心灵智慧的诞生（对希腊人来说）哲学不是一门学问，而是一种以寻求智慧为目的的生存方式，质言之，乃是一种精神生活。 智慧的痛苦来自内在于它自身的矛盾。智慧要把握无限和永恒，由于人本身的局限，这个目标永远不能真正达到。 以爱智慧为其本义的哲学，结果是否定智慧的价值，这个结果命中注定。哲学所追问的那个——一和全，绝对，终极，永恒，原是神的同义语，只可从信仰中得到，不可凭人的思维能力求得。 尽管人的智慧有其局限，爱智慧并非属于徒劳。智慧正是人超越自身局限的努力，唯凭此努力，局限才显现出来。人的灵魂不安于有生有灭的肉身生活的限制，寻求超越的途径，不管寻求有无结果，寻求本身使人和肉身生活保持了一个距离-自由。 哲学的魅力知识关乎事物，智慧关乎人生。 哲学不是智慧本身，而是对智慧的爱。 人生问题的答案不能只靠逻辑推理求得，真正起作用的是亲身的经历，切身的感受，灵魂深处的危机和觉醒，直觉和顿悟。 哲学的魅力在于它所寻求的人生智慧的魅力，在于寻求者的个性的魅力（在寻求真理的过程中体现）。 风格的前提是感受和思想的独创性。 哲学和诗 同源于神话 诗人没有哲学的眼光和深度只能沦为浅薄文人，哲学家没有诗的激情和灵性只能是思维机器 我们无需赞同哲学家对人生问题的答案，但是在哲学关心人生问题、具有个性特点、展现多样风格等方面，他们或可对我们有所启发。 哲学与随感录最早的哲学思考都是直觉和顿悟式的，由之形成的作品必是格言和语录体的（言简意赅，易于传诵）。 随感录的可贵在于真实。 诗是我的感情日记，随感是我的思想日记。 寻求智慧的人生 罗素 人生一切美好的东西不会因为其短暂性而失去价值 高尚的生活是受爱激励并由知识导引（理性调节）的生活 —— 爱与知识，本能与理智，二者不可或缺 靠本能与所爱者相处，靠理智与所恨者相处 —— 对待欢乐靠本能，对待不幸靠理智 婚姻、爱情、性三者可相对分开（现代西方最早提倡性自由的思想家之一） 第一，爱情高于单纯的性行为，没有爱的性行为没有价值 第二，“经历了多年考验且有许多深切感受的伴侣生活”高于一时的迷恋和钟情（前者包含后者所不具有的丰富内容） 爱和科学 爱是第一位的，科学离开爱的目标，只会使人盲目追求物质财富的增殖 爱的最危险的敌人是工作即美德的信念，急于在工作和财产上取得成功的贪欲 哲学世界里的闲人本真意义上的哲学（不是一门学术，也不是一种职业）是一个向一切探索人生真理的灵魂敞开的精神世界。 哲学与精神生活（康德：）权力的享有不可避免地会腐蚀理性批判，哲学对于政治的最好期望不是享有权力，而是享有言论自由。 哲学生活是一种沉思的生活，而所思问题的非实用性恰好保证了这种生活的自得其乐。 沉思（未必是哲学性的）之成为哲学性的，取决于所思问题的性质和求解的方法。 肉身生活和社会生活所满足的是人的外在的功利性需要。在此之外，人还有内在的精神性需要，其实质是对生命意义的寻求（不得满足，人便感到盲目不安）。 肉身生活和社会生活都具有经验性质，仅涉及我们与周围直接环境的联系。精神生活则把我们超拔于经验世界的有限性和暂时性，此时我们力求在一己的生命与某种永恒存在的精神性的世界整体之间建立一种联系。由于这种世界整体超越于经验，我们无法证明它，但我们必须有这一假定。真正的精神生活必具有超验性质，它总是指向一个超验领域的。凡灵魂之思，必有这样一种指向为其底蕴。所谓寻求生命的意义，亦即寻求建立这种联系。一个人如果相信自己已经建立了这种联系，便是拥有了一种信仰。因此，寻求意义即寻求信仰。 哲学本身所包含的矛盾和困难 —— 追问是宗教性的，寻求解决的方法是科学性的 关于“（感觉不可靠，只能感知现象）唯有理性才能认识现象界背后那个统一的、不变的本体界”这一思路的若干疑点 第一，感觉是我们感知外界的唯一手段，感觉不能证明在现象背后存在着一种本质 第二，理性不能证明它所追求的秩序是世界本身所固有的。关于秩序从何而来有两种可能的回答：一是从感觉经验中归纳而得（并不真正具有必然性和普遍性）；二是理性本身所固有的（意识的先天结构）。这两种回答解释的秩序仍然属于现象范围，与世界本来面目无关 第三，世界只有一种存在方式，即作为显现在意识中的东西——现象（胡塞尔：任何对象一旦进入认识就只能是现象（上帝也不例外）） 结论 —— 世界没有本体。哲学不可能成为科学，我们不能靠理性手段把握或构造哲学原本想要追问的那个本体，必须另辟蹊径。 广义的宗教精神和广义的哲学精神是相通的，两者皆是超验的追思。在狭义上，它们便有了区分，宗教在一个确定的信仰中找到了归宿，哲学却始终走在寻找信仰的途中。 哲学的好处 第一，哲学使我们在没有确定信仰的情况下仍能过一种有信仰的生活。它的矛盾的本性决定了它不可能提供一个确定的信仰，然后它的弱点同时是它的长处，寻找信仰而又不在某一个确定的信仰上停下来（优于宗教），使我们保持对某种（不能确知的）最高精神价值的向往 第二，哲学使我们在信仰问题上持一个宽容的态度。在现代的价值多元的情形下，不能也不该重建大一统的信仰。哲学（反对任何人以现代救世主自居）鼓励每个人自救（寻求自己的信仰） 第三，哲学的沉思使我们眼光开阔，使我们不致沉沦于劳作和消费的现代漩涡，仍然保持住心灵生活的标准 哲学不只是慰藉哲学不只是慰藉（调整人的心态），更是智慧（调整人看世界和人生的总体眼光）。 （塞内加：）人对有准备的、理解了的挫折承受力最强，反之受伤害最重。 哲学的作用就在于，第一，使人认识到任何一种坏事都可能发生，从而随时作好准备；第二，帮助人理解已经发生的坏事，认识到它们未必那么坏。 （无论是伊壁鸠鲁，还是继承了他的基本思想的后世哲学家，如英国功利主义者都主张）快乐应更多依赖于精神非物质（沉湎于物质快乐而不知精神快乐为何物的人可凭自己的空虚予以证明）。 孔子的洒脱君子而不仁者有矣夫 —— “仁”不是理性人格的必备条件 邦无道，乘桴浮于海（能逃就逃），言孙（逃不了则少说话），愚不可及（会装傻更妙）。 —— 不主张愚忠和滥恕 “愚不可及” —— 愚蠢透顶装傻装得高明极顶 用德公正报怨，用恩德报恩德。 言必信，行必果 —— 僵化小人之行径（径径然小人哉） 三思而后行 —— 再思即可 另一个韩愈 韩愈 毁谤的根源 —— 懒惰（自己不能优秀）和嫉妒（怕别人优秀） 当众夸不在场的某人，只有其朋党、与那人没有利害竞争的人以及惧怕那人的人表示赞同，其余一概不高兴 当众贬不在场的某人，上述三种人不表示赞同，其余的一概兴高采烈 小人好议论，不乐成人之美 人生知己难得 平生交往的朋友不算少，浅者不去说，深者也无非是因为同事、老相识、某方面兴趣相同之类表层的原因，还有的是因为一开始不了解而来往已经密切，后来不管喜欢与否也只好坚持下去了。 杞人是一位哲学家哲学之所以务虚，是因为人有一颗灵魂，使他在务实之外还要玄思，在关系眼前的事情之外还要追问所谓终极的存在。当然，（即使哲学家也不能不食人间烟火）起码的务实还有要有的。 哲学是灵魂的追问哲学是世界观和人生观，但无论世界观还是人生观，都是我们灵魂中的活动（而不是一套现成的意识形态）。哲学的价值（不在于提供确定的答案）在于使我们始终保持对世界和人生的惊疑和对根本问题的追问。 每个人需要的哲学的程度（与哲学之关系密切的程度），取决于他对精神生活看重的程度，精神生活在他的人生中所占的位置或比重。 终极关切 —— 人试图通过某种方式在自己的生命和世界的本质间建立一种联系从而觉得自己有了一个稳固的基础，一种永恒的终极的意义（否则感到不安) 哲学的两个永恒主题 —— 世界与我。在不同的哲学家那里，两者之中必有一个问题是元问题，另一个问题则处于派生地位，由此而分出了不同的哲学方法和风格。 哲学是爱智慧。对于智慧，有不同的看法，一派认为是思维方法的问题，另一派认为是灵魂的问题。 凡是有良好的哲学悟性的人，必定有过对于死亡的隐秘体验和痛苦觉悟。这种体悟实质上是一切形而上思考的源头，不从这源头流出的思考就决非真正形而上的。因此，差不多可以把对死亡的体悟看作衡量一个人哲学悟性的标志。 有的人（很聪明，很有理解力，甚至也很真诚）没有对死亡的体悟，你就很难和他作深入的哲学对话。 任何一个真正的哲学问题都不可能有所谓标准答案，可贵的是发问和探究的过程本身，使我们对那些根本问题的思考始终处于活泼的状态。 两千年来哲学的一个迷误是，混淆了灵魂和头脑所寻求的东西。 智慧不等于博学，哲学家不等于饱学之士。真正的哲人是寻求着人生智慧的探索者。 哲学（关乎人生的根本）的使命要求哲学家绝对真诚。 哲学家从来就有“仁者”和“智者”两类，所以他们所“见”出的哲学也从来就有唯“仁”（人本主义）和唯“智”（科学主义）两派。 人性不能一律，哲学倾向也不能一律。我主张哲学上的宽容。但宽容是承认对方的生存权利，而不是合流。 对哲学的相反理解 把哲学看作广义逻辑学，其对象是思维 把哲学看作广义美学，其对象是心灵的体验 试图揉合两种理解的结果总是不成功的 现代哲学的基本趋势是否定形而上学（哲学源自对世界追根问底的冲动，否定终极追问将使哲学失去存在的必要）。 对传统形而上学，应分两方面看 一方面，不可消除追根问底的冲动（其背后的动机是要给人生一个根本的解释） 另一方面，用逻辑手段建构终极的本体是错误的（其结果是离给生命意义以一个解释的初衷越来越远，甚至背道而驰） 解构主义热衷于文本的解构，以此挖掘文本的多义（与真正的哲学追问无关），所以我不承认解构主义是哲学。 哲学在理性与终极关切之间保持着一种紧张关系，一方面使终极价值处在永远不确定和被追问的状态，防止信仰的盲目，另一方面使理性不自囿于经验的范围，力求越界去解决更高的任务而不能，防止理性的狭隘和自负。 哲学必将带着它固有的矛盾向前发展，一代又一代的人必将不可遏止地思考那些没有最终答案的根本问题，并从这徒劳的思考中获得教益。 哲学是分身术，把精神自我从肉体自我中分离出来，并立足于精神自我，与那个肉体自我拉开距离，不被它所累。如果这种距离达到无限远，肉体和自我等于不存在了，便是宗教的境界了。 形而上学实际上是人和自己较劲。人本是有限，必归于虚无，不甘心，于是想上升为神，变成无限（人终归不能成为神）。也许应该在无限和虚无间，也肯定有限的价值。 哲学与诗艺术用审美净化性的烦恼，哲学用智慧净化死的恐惧。 性兼是死和死的拯救 性和癫狂一方面给人以个体解体即死的体验 另一方面又是种族生命延续即抗拒死的唯一手段 诗借瞬时把握永恒。哲学想直接把握永恒，但做不到，最后只好向诗求援。 在我的概念中，只有学术和非学术的区别，没有哲学和文学的区别。哲学是对人生的思考和体悟，文学则是对之的丰满而贴切的表达。 智慧的极限在于认清人生之谜的无解。 非理性主义哲学的流行也许比理性主义更严重地败坏了人的非理性（分析、解剖、砍伐人的直觉、本能、情绪、体验，使非理性的感受丧失其个人当下的独特性和生命的原始性，被符号化——理性化）。 有的人喜欢用哲学语汇表达日常的体验，我喜欢用日常语汇表达哲学的体验。 哲学家理性强的人研究自然，追求真，作科学家。意志强的人研究社会，追求善，做政治家。情感强的人研究人，追求美，做艺术家。哲学家无非也分成这三类，何尝有纯粹的哲学家？ 所谓哲学家包括四种截然不同的类型 政客型的哲学家把哲学当作谋权的手段 庸人型的哲学家把哲学当作饭碗 学者型的哲学家把哲学当作纯学术 真正的哲学家把哲学当作生命 前两者——圆的方 四种哲学家（区分是相对的） 哲学就业者，把哲学当作饭碗，对哲学本身并无兴趣 哲学学者，把哲学当作学术，做知识性的整理和解释工作，研究前人和别人思考的结果，确实有这方面的兴趣或成绩 哲学大师，真正是独立思考，对世界和人生的思考提出了新思路，创建了新体系，并产生重大影响，改变了哲学史 哲人，爱智慧者，把哲学当作生活方式 哲学本质上只能自学，哲学家必定是自学成才的，如说有老师，也是直接师事历史上的大哲人。 个人思维犹如人类思维一样，走着从混沌（感性）到分化（知性）到整合（理性）的路 有的人终生停留在第一阶段，其低能者成为可笑的老孩子，才高者成为艺术者 多数人在第二阶段止步，视其才能的高低而成为一知半解者或科学家 达到第三阶段的是哲学家 哲学本身不具备娱乐的价值。哲学无论好坏都成不了消费品。一个人要么不需要哲学，要么需要好的哲学。 靠哲学谋生完全是一种寄生。 我不想与以哲学为职业的专门家讨论哲学，宁愿与热爱哲学的门外汉交谈——但也不是谈哲学。 智慧智慧——由单纯到复杂再复归成熟的单纯；彻悟——由混沌到清醒再复归自觉的混沌。 智慧是灵魂的事，博学是头脑的事，更糟的是舌头的事。 知识关心人的限度之内的事，智慧关心人的限度之外的事。 一种回避生命的悲剧性质的智慧无权称作智慧，只配称作生活的精明。 对人生的觉悟来自智慧，倘若必待大苦大难然后开悟，慧根也未免太浅。 —— 不能从间接经验中更早地获得智慧 最低的境界是平凡，其次是超凡脱俗，最高的是返璞归真的平凡。 野心——平常心——慧心。 童心和成熟并不互相排斥。一个人在精神上足够成熟，能够正视和承受人生的苦难，同时心灵依然单纯，对世界仍然怀着儿童般的兴致，这完全是可能的。我不认为麻木、僵化、世故是成熟，真正的成熟应该具有生长能力，因而毋宁说在本质上始终是包含着童心。 第九辑 希腊的智慧玩骰子的儿童就哲学写作而言，简练是一个基本要求。简练所追求的是不晦涩，即用最准确因而也就是最少而精的语言表达已想清楚的道理。 一个珍爱自己思想的哲学家应该这样写作：一方面，努力让那些精致的耳朵听懂每一句话，另一方面，决不为了让那些粗糙的耳朵听懂——它们反正听不懂——而多说一句不必要的话。如此写出的作品，其风格必是简练的。 真理躲藏在人类语言之外的地方，哲人只好说隐喻。 未经省察的人生没有价值 苏格拉底 人心固有向善的倾向，应该把它唤醒，循此倾向去追寻它的源头 以接生婆自居 —— 爱智慧是潜藏在人的灵魂中的最宝贵特质，哲学的作用就是催生这种特质 哲学就是学习死，学习处于死的状态。 —— 哲学家所追求的是使灵魂超脱肉体。灵魂不受肉体包括它的欲望和感觉的纠缠，在平静中生存，只用理性追求真理，它的这种状态就叫智慧。 关心自己的灵魂，度一个有价值的人生 不要挡住我的阳光群体利益常是禁止言论自由的主要理由。 “不要挡住我的阳光” —— （另一层含义）不要让政治挡住哲学，不要让群体利益挡住思想自由。 第十辑 哲学和时代哲学的命运我们时代既需要德国哲学的思辨品格，也需要法国哲学的实践品格，而两者都是哲学的题中应有之义。 哲学与孩子与通俗化我对哲学在今天的命运并不悲观——一、我从来不期望哲学成为热门，哲学成为热门未必是好事；二、在任何时代，总有不讲究实用的一代人——涉世未深的少年儿童。 通 —— 一个作者对自己所处理的题目融会贯通，因而能与相应的读者沟通，在这两方面均无阻隔 俗 —— 内容的浅显和形式的易于流行 哲学与我们时代 大体而论，哲学有四种不同的存在形式 一是作为形而上学的沉思和伟大思想体系的创造，它属于哲学史上的天才 二是作为学术，它属于学者 三是作为思潮或意识形态，它属于大众 四是作为人生思考，它属于每一个不愿虚度人生的人 前两种属于少数人，不过学者与天才之间有着天壤之别。同样，后两种属于多数人， 一个人（不是作为大众追随一种思潮）作为独立的个人思考人生，更符合哲学之本义，这时候他离哲学更近了。 真正的成功首先应是做人的成功，即做一个精神上优秀的人，生活得有意义，而事业的成功不过是做人的成功的一个自然结果而已。 人们越是被世俗化潮流胁迫着拼搏在功利战场上，生活在人生的表面，心中就越是为意义的缺失而困惑，而焦虑。因此哲学仅在表面上似乎成了弃妇，实际上却是许多人的梦中情人。 轻视哲学的民族不可能优秀哲学对于决心以之为终身志业的人有很高的要求，不容存名利之想。 知识之最高之满足，必求诸哲学。 —— 王国维 为了澄清对哲学的普遍误解，让人们感受到哲学的魅力，就有必要改革我们的哲学课程，第一步是把它从政治课中分离出来，恢复它作为爱智慧的本来面貌和作为最高问题之思考的独立地位。 谁来上哲学课在哲学课上，传授知识只居于次要地位，首要目标是点燃对智慧的爱，引导学生思考世界和人生的重大问题。 关于“纯粹哲学” 接近或进入哲学可以有三种方式 一是学术的方式，围绕哲学史或哲学理论中某一课题系统地搜集和整理材料，在此基础上对之作清晰的论述 二是思想的方式，对那些最基本的哲学问题进行独立思考，沉浸于其中 三是精神的方式，因自己灵魂中的困惑而发生追问，寻求理性的解决 三种方式本身无高低之分，如一定要说高低，全在于那个从事哲学的人的心性和智性 关于所谓“生活哲学”，举出的特征有二 一是已经脱离了哲学的基本问题和基本要求，没有“哲学味”了 二是不同于那些真正探讨哲学问题的作品之让人觉得“晦涩难懂”，想必是让人觉得明白易懂的了 如果说纯粹哲学乃至一切纯粹的精神之物在今天面临着危险，那么，在我看来，主要的危险就在这里，在学术和教育机构中的腐败，在学术界大量从业者的急功近利。 哲学是弃妇又是梦中情人如果把哲学看作精神生活的理性形式，那么，它在商业社会的处境是矛盾的。一方面，追逐实利的普遍倾向必然使它受到冷落。另一方面，追逐实利的结果是精神空虚，凡是感受到这种空虚并且渴望改变的人便可能愈加倾心于哲学。 哲学与社会哲学是非时代（永恒）、反时代（批判）的，它立足于永恒之根本，批判时代舍本求末的迷途倾向。 历史是时代的坐标，哲学是人生的坐标。 哲学家对社会现实可有两种态度 一种是完全不关心 （黑格尔：）哲学是一间隔壁的圣所，它的祭司必须远离俗世，潜心真理。 另一种是有所关心，从坚守人类最基本的精神价值的角度来关心政治 （席勒：）在精神的意义上，摆脱特定国家和时代的束缚，做一切时代的公民，是哲学家的特权和责任。 一个伟大的哲学家是一个伟大的提问者，他的问题 一、是对世界和人生的根本性追问 二、是他的时代的精神生活中的重大问题（对时代发生巨大影响） 三、他的提问和寻求答案的方式改变了哲学史上的旧思路，启示了新思路，使他在哲学史上具有重要地位 一个哲学家对哲学对象和使命的看法，往往同他对人生价值的追求纠结在一起，其中渗透着他的个性。 哲学无国别。 中国现在尤其需要的是不受传统、习俗、舆论、教条束缚的自由灵魂，人生和社会问题的真诚的探索者，出不出大哲学家倒在其次。 如果有一种东西，始则充当权力的奴仆，继而沦为金钱的乞丐，我们便可断定它不是哲学。 哲学当然是高贵的。它的高贵还表现在这一点上：它绝没有做众学科之王这样的世俗野心。 我不相信一种在任何事情上都可以插上一嘴的东西是哲学。 第十一辑 传统与人文精神读鲁迅的不同眼光虚无及对虚无的反抗，孤独及孤独中的充实，是鲁迅和尼采这两位巨人的最深邃的相通之处。 《李白与杜甫》内外政治的尺子不能衡量一个伟人 人类的敦煌对于中国境内的一切历史遗物，我们不仅应该把它们看做民族的财产，还应该把它们看做人类的文化遗产（不但对民族负责，还该对人类负责）。 中国人缺少什么百年来的文化反省遗漏了中华文化传统中的一个严重弱点（且成了不可动摇的前提）——重实用价值而轻精神价值 严复 —— 用实用眼光向西方寻求真理（英国哲学：重功利、重经验知识） 西方政治制度有其哲学上的根据 《群己权界论》（《论自由》-约翰·穆勒） 主旨 —— 确定社会对于个人的合法权力的限度，为个人自由辩护 论点 —— 个人自由本身就是好的，就是目的，是人类幸福不可缺少的因素，它使得人类的生活丰富多样，生气勃勃 出发点 —— 一个人自己规划其存在的方式总是好的，（不是因为这方式本身算是好的）因为这是他自己的方式 王国维 —— 重视精神价值的一个例外（德国哲学：重思辨、重形而上学） 主张大学文科必须设立（西方）哲学专科和哲学公共课（认为西方哲学才是纯粹哲学） 哲学 性质 —— 哲学就是形而上学，即对宇宙人生做出解释，以解除我们灵魂中的困惑 推论 其一，既然哲学寻求的是“天下万世之真理，非一时之真理”，那么，它的价值必定是非实用的，不可能符合“当世之用”。但这不说明它没有价值，相反，它具有最神圣、最尊贵的精神价值。“无用之用”胜于有用之用，精神价值远高于实用价值，因为它满足的是人的灵魂的需要，其作用也要久远得多。 其二，也正因此，坚持哲学的独立品格便是哲学家的天职，决不可把哲学当作政治和道德的手段。推而广之，一切学术都如此，唯以求真为使命，不可用做任何其他事情的手段，如此才可能有“学术之发达”。 （本世纪初）中国人最缺精神文明 精神文明 核心 —— 对精神价值的尊敬（承认精神有物质不可比拟的神圣价值和不可用物质尺度来衡量的独立价值） 一个民族精神文明的成就体现在它在哲学、宗教、文学、艺术上所达到的高度 中国人缺少对精神价值的尊敬，从而也缺少对守护和创造了精神价值的人的尊敬。 中国人、中国文化缺少精神性 精神性 所谓精神性，包括理性和超越性两个层次 理性属于头脑 超越性属于灵魂 超越性即有自己的灵魂（认真追问人生的问题，自己为自己的生命寻求一个意义，自己来确定在世间安身立命的原则和方式） 人类知识的根据的可靠性面临两大难题 第一，如果说与对象符合的认识才是真知，可是对象本身又永远不能在我们意识中出现，一旦出现就成了我们的认识，那么，我们如何可能将二者比较而判断其是否符合？ 第二，我们承认经验是知识的唯一来源，同时我们又相信在人类的知识中有一种必然的普遍的知识，它们不可能来自有限的经验，那么，它们从何而来？ 知识论是中国传统哲学的最薄弱的环节之一（即使讨论，也偏于知行关系问题。在中国哲学史上，从总体上怀疑知识之可靠性的只有庄子，但基本上没有后继者，宋明时期所讨论的知识偏于道德认识，程朱的格物致知的“知”，陆王的尽心穷理的“理”皆如此，分歧只在悟道的途径）。 西方人从事研究只以真知为目的，中国人从事研究以效用为目的（难深入，一旦觉得够用，就会停止，理论思维不严密，满足于模棱两可，大而化之）。 热爱真理源于在知识问题上的认真。 中西哲学 知识论 前者较薄弱 人生哲学 两者人生思考的核心问题不同 前者是怎么活（怎样处世做人），后者是为什么活（活着有什么根据，什么意义） 中国的人生哲学本质上是道德哲学，是伦理学 两者差异的原因 推测很可能是因为对死抱着不同的态度 前者回避死的问题（孔子——“未知生，焉知死”，庄子——“以死生为一条”），后者重视死的问题（死使人生一切价值面临毁灭的威胁） 中国缺少形而上学和宗教（人生思考只局限于人生内部事务的安排）。 儒家哲学中的宇宙论仅是道德学说的延伸（不具备形而上学的品格），然后回头用做其道德学说的论证。 天人合一 —— 支配着宇宙和人伦的是同一种道德秩序 个人自由是价值和目的（而不是手段） 如果一个人不觉得有必要用自己的头脑思考问题，思想自由对他就确实不重要 如果他不觉得有必要让自己的灵魂来给自己的人生做主，信仰自由对他就确实不重要 （哈耶克：）自由之所以重要，正是因为人人生而不同，每个人的独特性是每个人的生命的独特意义之所在；而强制之所以可恶，正是因为它把人看成了没有自己的思想和自己的灵魂的东西。 灵魂的严肃和丰富是一切美德之源，一个对自己生命的意义麻木不仁的人是不可能对他人有真正的同情之感、对社会有真正的责任心的。 中国知识分子表面上的社会承担并不缺，真正缺的是独立品格（表面的社会承担多，内在的精神关切少）。 社会责任心若没有精神关切为底蕴就只能是一种功利心。 人性在其基本方面是共通的。 人是理性的动物（有头脑，有理性的认识能力） 人是形而上学的动物（有灵魂，不但要活而且要活得有意义） 中国文化已经形成了其实用品格。值得注意的是，一旦形成之后，这种文化便具有了一种淘汰机制，其发生作用的方式是：对实用性予以鼓励，纳入主流和传统之中，对精神性则加以排斥，使之只能成为主流和传统之外的孤立现象。 为了把这一页翻过去 我们应真正具备 现代文明世界一员的自信，强壮得既不怕自己的传统，也不怕外来的文化，对两者都泰然处之。 现代民主社会公民的从容，不激愤于政局又消沉于书斋，不把政治作为关注的中心，不把学术作为一种逃避，从政和治学都该是我们作为具有独立人格的公民的自由选择。 真正的学术要有恒久性和世界性 真正的学术 （决非一时一地之物）必具有恒久性和世界性。把玩国故，不拘于考据、训诂，能通宇宙之至妙，人生之精髓，启迪天下人心扉。治理西学，不限于述评、比较，能体悟和理解，与宗师大家交流。 是一种对话，不仅与国人、今人对话，而且与洋人、后人对话。 创新（不靠移花接木，搬弄新术语）首先要在学术上有根。 学者的使命学者的社会使命（不是关注当下的政治事务）是在理论上阐明并且捍卫那些决定社会基本走向的恒久的一般原则。 学术的独立（不表现为学者们频频发表政治见解）的前提是要有真学术，即建立起一个坚实的学术传统。 中国人包括中国的学者历来看重事功，即使关心道德修养也有强烈的实用目的，而缺少对个人灵魂生活的关注。 一个人有无真正的灵魂生活，亦即是否具有对于自己生命意义的严肃态度，乃是他在世上的一切责任心包括社会责任心的至深根源。 一切精神杰作都是个人在寂寞中独立劳作的产物。 一个真爱学问的人不只是耐得寂寞，毋宁说这种寂寞是他的自觉选择，是他的正常生存状态，他在其中自得其乐，获得最大的心灵满足（而不是不愉快，那样的耐得寂寞就或是荒唐的）。 识见是学养的灵魂（有识见，学养才是活的）。 围绕某一主题读书和写作——学术；主题固定不变，不读与主题无关的书和不写与主题无关的文章——纯粹的学者。 文明对于不同的人，进入其不同的心理层次。进入意识层次，只是学问；进入无意识层次，才是教养。 从事人文研究的三种方式 一，学者的方式：严格地做学问，讲究规范和方法，注重材料的发现、整理和解释 二，才子的方式：潇洒地玩学问，讲究趣味和技巧，易卖弄机智和才情 三，思想者的方式：通过学问求真理或信仰，注重精神上的关切 真正的学术研究 是一种以问题为核心的系统研究 具体内容 弄清思考的基本问题 弄清问题的解决方案 弄清解决方案的形成过程 弄清是否还留有未解决的疑点或难点 同一问题在思想史上和当代思想界的提出及不同解决方案之间的比较 等等 要求 兼具思想的洞见和学术的功底 东西方文化圣哲及后继者关于人类某些具有永久性的根本问题的思想对于一切民族一切时代的人都有启示意义。 看待东西方文化需要一种平常心（不假思索就喜欢和接纳一切好东西的健康本能）。 一切关于东西方文化之优劣的谈论都是非文化、伪文化性质的。民族文化是一个政治概念。 无论东方还是西方，文化中最有价值的东西必定是共通的，是属于全人类的（那些仅属于东方或西方的东西只有次要的价值）。 智慧无国籍。 人类基本的真理始终是相同的，变化的只是对它们的表达以及那些次要的真理。 人性和人生基本境况是不变的，人类不分古今东西都面临某些永恒的根本问题，对这些问题的思考构成了一切精神文化的核心。 按照国别选择思想家的人真正看重的（不是思想）是民族的虚荣。 儒教其实是处世术，道教其实是养身术，儒道释合流其实是统治术。 中国人中庸。西方人走极端，古罗马疯狂享乐，中世纪严格禁欲，这种彻底性往往会出大师。他们也讲中庸，然而是结合了两极的中庸。 斯多噶派建立了两个重要传统 一是在上帝的法律面前人人平等 二是个人关注内在生活 论思想一个新思想无非是看事物的一个新角度，仅仅是一个角度，但倡导者把它看作唯一的角度，把它变成轴心了（新思想的倡导者在某种程度上都是偏执狂）。 在人类文化发展过程中，对新角度的偏执迟早被克服，新角度却永远地保留下来了，使人类看事物的角度日益多样，灵魂，自由。于是，偏执辩证地导致了灵活。 论误解的必然和必要 人类思想凭借误解而发展 独立的思想家凭借误解前人思想而形成 诠释是自我生长的一种方式 一个思想家一旦形成他一生中的主导思想，他便成熟了，此后他只是在论证、阐释、应用、发挥、丰富他的这个主导思想。很少有人根本改变自己的主导思想，且其结果往往是不幸的——多半不是确立了一个新的主导思想，而只是转入了他人的思想轨道，丧失了自己的活力和特色。 人类境遇在社会变化中的一致性使得人类相隔若干年往往独立发现同一真理。 世界的真理始终处在快要说出来却永远没有说出来的边缘上，而这就证明了它确实是存在的。 在思想史领域中，如果我们的作者都去写自己真正感兴趣的思想家，并且仅限于写自己真正有感受的侧面，如此产生的成果放到一起，要比人人都写面面俱到的评介文章更能反映思想史和思想家的真实面貌，“主观”的方式达到了更“客观”的效果。 开放不是兼收并蓄。一种思想有其独特性，又能与其它思想对话，就是有开放性了。 思想停止了，才有思想。一切思想都是回忆。 感情的极端是痴，思想的极端是疯。 有时思想孕育于沉默，而靠谈话催产。有时思想孕育于谈话，而靠沉默催产。 感觉间没有路，只能跳跃。思想间有漫长的路，必须跋涉。前者靠灵巧，后者靠耐力。 真理是人人知道而只有一个人敢说出来的东西，也可能是人人都不知道而只有一个人知道却不肯说出来的东西。 （对于精致的耳朵来说）真理在人云亦云的过程中被抹去了个性，从而丧失了原初的真实性。有个性的谎言比无个性的真理更为“真实”。 不存在事实，只存在对事实的解释。当一种解释被经验所证明时，我们便称它为真理。由于经验总是有限的，所以真理总是相对的。 针对整个世界及其本质、起源、目的等等的永远不能被经验所证明或否定的解释——信仰。 理想是立足于价值立场的对人生或者社会的解释。 先知与智者的区别在于他不但思考，而且把思考变成行动，在行动中思考，用行动来思考。 箴言与隽语的区别，在于它的异乎寻常的重量，不管你是否理解它或喜欢它，你都不能不感觉到这重量。]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F06%2F15%2F2018-06-18-Die_philosophische_Hintertreppe-note%2F</url>

“激情”（这种爱）。战胜性欲，才能步入这种更高级的爱中（性爱不能停留在感官享受本身，更不能发展为纵欲荒淫） 柏拉图式的爱 建立在人格尊重上的精神上的爱慕 热爱和追求事物的本质(然后才会产生真正的对永恒的追求) 只有从正义的原本出发，我们才能判断某个行为是否正义的，是否比另一个行动更合乎正义 人在出生前已看到了理念 哲学 - 对智慧的爱 Chapter 5 亚里士多德——见世面的哲学家 亚里士多德(Aristoteles)（柏拉图的学生） 生命存在是个有机的整体，只有这个整体能赋予各部件各自不同的意义（部分的意义基于整体） 所有存在都按其固有的可能性不断地追求自我实现，整个宇宙都在不停息地向完美的方向发展（宇宙观目的论） 自我实现（将本质中已有的可能性化为现实） - 人的生存的关键 基于此，成为人道主义学派的开山祖师 成为你自己（人道主义的最高准则）(前提条件：人能够充分意识到，自己是整个宇宙中不可分割的部分) 人本为善，人的道德义务在于将自己本质中原始的善良变为现实 人的本质特点（与其它动物的不同之处）是“(logos)逻各斯（精神、理性）” 万物皆有意义，人的生存的本来意义（要使只有人具有的“逻各斯”变为现实）是发挥自己独有的才能，真正成为人（有理性的动物） logos （对希腊人来说）认识事物、表达事物、解释宇宙世界的能力 人的使命（生存的真正目的和意义）在于认识世界（人的最高级的生活方式应是认识者的生活方式） 只有理性是衡量一切的正确标准 世界是建立在一个最先引起运动的东西上的，而其本身是不动的 神灵（世界所有运动所追求的最现实圆满的对象）是世界自身不断运动的最终目的 神灵是逻各斯，是理性，是世界上最完美崇高的存在 上帝即精神，或许说上帝甚至超载了精神 神灵单纯认识自身，潜心观察自身的本质 Chapter 6 伊壁鸠鲁与芝诺——无官司一身轻与不幸的义务 伊壁鸠鲁(Epicurus)（享乐主义的创始人） 快感是幸福生活的本源和目的 快感首先指的是精神方面的更细腻的兴奋感觉 真正的快感与幸福源于灵魂的平衡和安静 最高级的快乐源于理性（没有理性的生活，不是充满快乐的生活；反之，没有快乐的生活，肯定不是理性的生活） 自然 继承德谟克利特的原子学说（宇宙中真正的存在是数量上无穷无尽、大小形状各异、重量不等的原子） 死亡（灵魂不得安宁的根源）即虚无 灵魂会死（对彼岸的恐惧随之消失） 研究哲学为了灵魂的和平 人的义务是实现自己所特有的意念（即自我实现） 芝诺(Zeno)（禁欲主义的创始人，斯多葛学派） 人通过与自然合一才能与自身保持一致（人的自我实现和人的天性有紧密联系，人的天性和外界自然处于和谐中） 自然的本质是神灵（自然法则） 世界是神圣的，人也是神圣的 人的本质是理性（与位于整个现实之中的世界理性相符合，是人可能认识到真理的根源） 自由 人的本质（理性）决定人的自由 自由就是自愿顺从自然法则 道德就是“心灵与理性的和谐” 生活理想是“无激情”（面对命运的打击也毫不动摇） 义务即行动合乎理性尊严的思想高于一切（人必须献身社会） 两者 共同点 从当时的现实环境出发 关心的是人尤其是哲学的地位问题 不同点 生活 前者主张遁世隐居 后者主张献身社会（义务为先） 生活的意义 前者认为在于快乐和享受中 后者认为在生活的一致中 自然的本质 前者继承原子论 后者认为是神灵（自然法则） 认识自然的目的 前者为了避免和排除来自世界方面的干扰 后者为了区别善恶（从道德方面把握自己的本质） 义务 前者主张自我实现 后者主张促进社会发展 Chapter 7 布洛汀——一个如醉如痴的人 布洛汀(Plotin)（公元三世纪最重要的思想家） 特点 敌视肉体和感官欲望（遁世思想） 没有留下著作（同苏格拉底） 神明 - “纯粹的单一”（通过否定描述神明） 单一先于多样，多样来自单一（单一扩张为世界） 爱 - 向往（意味着某种缺憾） 世界观 - 现实世界来自于世界灵魂，所以世界也是完美的 灵魂首先回归自我，最后回归神明 灵魂的回归 第一步：用社会生活所要求的道德标准衡量自己 第二步：彻底摆脱感官享受 第三步：单纯的感觉上升为精神 第四步：无知无识（沉浸自我，超越思维），进入“灵魂无法进入的地方”（才有可能与神明真正合一） Chapter 8 奥古斯汀——浪子回头金不换 奥古斯汀(Augustinus)（基督教哲学家，哲学的目光开始完全转向人的内心） 著作 《忏悔录》 - 将自身当作哲学研究的对象 基本信仰 只有着眼于自己，观察自己的内心，人才能得到真理 人的本质 荒谬迷惘与渴望超越（由此产生不安） 如何解除（人的本质所固有的）迷惘 早期 - 人是自由的，人应该也能够对自己的行为负责 后期 - 反对赋予人以自由（有损上帝的尊严） 结论 - 人应该屈服于神圣的秘密 由记忆力、意志力与观察力三部分组成 认识 以信仰为前提（理性服从信仰） 人只能以间接的方式为基础认识上帝 上帝存在 人在观察自己的内心时能发现有真理存在 因此必然存在用来衡量理性是否符合真理的高于理性的标尺 超越理性的是上帝 结论 - 衡量真理的标尺，即上帝，必然存在着 人可以认识上帝的存在和本质 我们知道我们存在着，我们对善良完美的东西的追求是上帝引起的，因此上帝是我们追求的最高级的存在，是所有追求与愿望的目的，是最高级的善 人可以从创造自己的上帝在自己身上遗留的痕迹推导上帝的特征，以类比为基础间接把握上帝的本质 人类历史（某种意义上的西方第一个最伟大的历史神学家和历史哲学家） 历史的开始（不是从人开始的）是丑恶的天使们的降落 历史的中心是基督的到来 历史的结尾是世界末日的审判，丑恶将受到惩罚 上帝的意志决定人类的历史的重大变化 围绕人的世界与上帝的王国展开对所有问题的思考，从人出发认识理解神圣的东西 哲学研究对象 第一 - 上帝 第二 - 超越了世界的灵魂 Chapter 9 安塞姆——确实有个上帝 安塞姆(Anselm)（基督教哲学家） 思维与信仰的关系 把握真理，两者不可缺一 信仰（透明的、可信的）必须位于认识之前 信仰必然促使我们去认识 上帝存在 所有存在都以一个绝对的存在-上帝为前提 上帝是完美的，所以存于理性和现实两者中 Chapter 10 托马斯——经过宗教洗礼的理性 托马斯(Thomas von Aquin)（基督教哲学家，亚里士多德的学生） 献身于自己的事业 - 重新奠定基督教哲学和基督教神学的基础 综合信仰与理性 著作很多（赋予亚里士多德哲学一个合理相应的地位，同时保存通过信仰得到的真理） 《神学大全》 - 最著名，未完成 《反异教大全》 - 姊妹篇，偏重哲学 信仰与理性各占有自己独立的领域 用理性判断感性经历从而认识世界（信仰的对象位于自然真理之上，认识现实事物无关信仰） 在一定范围内，理性有能力认识上帝（人可以从现实世界出发认识到上帝的存在以及上帝的某些一般特征） 信仰与理性都来自上帝（避免双重真理并存） 哲学研究对象 第一 - 上帝 第二 - 世界本身 事物的本质 现实世界 - 统一完整，内容丰富，无所不包（等级：无生命事物 -&gt; 植物（植物性灵魂） -&gt; 人（精神性灵魂） -&gt; 天使（纯粹的非创造性精神） -&gt; 上帝（纯粹的创造性精神）） 认识 人只能认识上帝的理念（而不能自由创造自己对世界的看法） 上帝超越我们所有的想象（是所有存在的第一起因） Chapter 11 埃柯哈特——上帝即非上帝 埃柯哈特(Eckhart) 神秘思辨 遁世 放弃所有现实存在 彻底放弃自我（将自我消失在上帝中） 上帝 无法被认识，无名无姓（无法被了解和表达） 超越所有实体的虚无 非上帝、非精神、非人非物非像 某种纯洁明亮的无矛盾和对立的单一 如何认识上帝 摆脱上帝，沉入虚无 Chapter 12 尼古拉——有关上帝的名词汇编 尼古拉(Nikolaus von Cues) 宗教 保皇派 著作 数量可观，《论天主教和平》《试论我们知道自己无知》《论追求智慧》《门外汉论智慧》《门外汉论精神》《论追求上帝》《直观的顶峰》《论起源》《论掩藏着的上帝》《论信仰带来的和平》等 统一位于无限、上帝中 上帝 上帝是无限 无法被认识 结论 - 接触上帝的所有可能只能来自于上帝的自我显示（为了天启放弃思辨神学） 思辨神学 上帝无法被认识，但人们可以在“向往”中接近它（无法把握认识上帝） 神秘经验，单纯直观（看不到上帝） 否定神学 主要特征 - 人只能通过否定句描述上帝 思维目的 - 彻底拉开上帝与所有有限存在间的无限距离 Chapter 13 笛卡尔——戴面具的哲学家 笛卡尔(Descartes) 哲学思考 没有哲学思考的生活如同一个人闭着眼睛而不想睁开 哲学思考 - 提出和解决形而上学方面的问题（解决问题需要创造一个可靠的基础） 怀疑 外部世界的存在 我们自身的肉体存在 构成所有认识的基础 自我独立性（哲学基础） 我思（或怀疑或受骗），故我在 “我”的本质 - 思维（是可靠的）（近代哲学由此将现实存在分成与世界无关的主观和纯粹的客观） 现实存在的起源（形而上学的根本问题） 难题 - 人完全可能生活在迷误中 上帝 - 人的心灵深处的完美实体理念是上帝的理念，而不是自身实体不完美的人创造出来的，所以上帝存在 循环结论 前提 - 人不可能成为永恒理念（完美实体的理念）的起因 理由 - 起因与因它而引起的东西是同等的 重建形而上学的尝试一开始就失败 解除怀疑 上帝是完美的，不会将人置于迷误中，所以上帝只能是纯粹的真理 Chapter 14 巴斯卡——被钉上十字架的理性 巴斯卡(Pascal) 座右铭 人必须认识自己 著作 《宗教论》（未完成） 双重无限理论 自然是无限大的 宇宙实际存在的最小单位无限小 所有事物来自于虚无，上升为无限 人活在矛盾中 思维力量大 - 人可在精神上把握所有存在及宇宙整体 生命脆弱 - “人是一根会思考的芦苇” 信仰（使人得到真正的安全感） 源自于心灵，而不是理性 定义 - 心灵感知上帝（非理性，无客观性） 理性 理性的最后一步，就是承认事物的无限性，承认事物超越理性 唯一符合理性的，就是不承认理性 只有彻底征服理性，我们才能真正认识自己 全面崩溃之时，思维所能做的，只有放弃思维 Chapter 15 斯宾诺莎——对真理的封锁 斯宾诺莎(Spinoza)（笛卡尔的学生） 生活 隐居；肺结核 著作 《论理性的完美》 生活中所遇到的一切是虚荣所致 热爱永恒的无限的存在，才能获得唯一真正的快乐，抛弃所有的忧愁 《伦理学》 出发点 - 上帝是自身的起因 上帝 上帝是唯一实体，事物和人的精神是其变体（世界是上帝存在的一种方式人的思考是上帝思考的一种方式） Chapter 16 莱布尼茨——有趣的单子拼盘游戏 莱布尼茨(Leibniz) 生活 一辈子旅馆流浪生活，终身未婚 科学研究（涉猎之广仅次于亚里士多德） 发现二进位制 著作 《辩神论》 单子(monade)论 事物的现实存在不只是事物的“延伸”，（修正补充笛卡尔的观点）还包括力量点（任何物体中都有力量点起作用）。 最小的力量点-单子(monade)是不可分的，而物质是可以无穷无尽被分割的 所有单子都具有生命力 每个生物体内都有一个中心，一种起作用的规律、一个自身的单位在组织和引导着生物的一切活动，所以所有现实存在都可通过类比得到解释 无生命的存在要从有生命的存在出发去解释，两者中的力量点具有类比关系 力量点的特点是概念与运动 精神的本质特点（从精神出发解释单子的本质） 有概念，可想象 总是从一个概念向另一个概念运动 表面存在背后有一个本来存在-有生命力的力量点-单子 概念 模糊型 清晰型 只有模糊概念的单子组成无机物 既有模糊概念又有清晰概念的单子组成有机物 上帝是只有清晰概念的原始单子 认识 人的认识过程，是那些中心单子，即统治人体中其他单子的单子，从模糊概念过渡到清晰概念的过程 单子间的相互关系 无互相影响 - 单子所产生的一切变化都是单子自身发展的结果 单子世界为何不会是混乱的 每个单子从一开始就有一种调节着单子一切变化的内部原理 具有清晰概念的单子如何感知外界存在 假设 每个单子一开始就以混乱的方式包含对其他所有单子的概念 单子的概念包括了现实存在，过去发生的和将来要发生的事物 “先天和谐”理论 - 不同单子间的所有变化一开始就是互相配合、先天和谐的 - 上帝安排的 总括 上帝创造宇宙的思想 证明上帝存在（保证单子论的高度统一） 现实存在是诸多完美体之一，作为包括所有完美的东西的完美体的上帝必然存在 现实中永恒的真理（比如数学定理）或实体必然有一个起源，即上帝的智慧 先天和谐系统需要一个安排一切负责调节单子世界发生的事情的精神实体，即上帝 上帝的本质及职能 本质 所有单子的起源 职能 计算在世界上发生的事情，为每个单子制定其内部规律，使单子间互相配合 用无数目光观察世界，每一道目光代表一个单子 - 目光点的多样性 世界上为何有痛苦、贫穷与丑恶 这个世界从整体上看是有限的，所以不可能所有的东西同时是完美的，上帝没办法，只好将丑恶与痛苦混杂在善良和美好中 Chapter 17 伏尔泰——陷入困境的理性 伏尔泰(Voltaire) 生活 及时行乐 - （神学解释）上帝把我们送到这个世界上是为了让我们享乐开心，其它的一切都是庸俗的、可怜的、难以忍受的 宗教 反对基督教 反对无神论 认识 人自身可以认识上帝 证明上帝存在 任何东西不可能产生于虚无，所以有一个永恒的神明-上帝存在着 相同不变的法则是某个制造者-上帝制造的 人的享受是上帝的恩赐 从理性到怀疑主义 人需要上帝惩恶扬善，没有上帝也要创造上帝 苦难中，人无法分清善与恶 人周围的一切都是无法解开的谜 哲学的意义 帮助行动（制定法律，推动民族独立） 消除忧虑，获得安慰 Chapter 18 卢梭——感情型哲学家的不幸 卢梭(Rousseau) 著作 《忏悔录》 《论科学与艺术》、《论人类不平等的起源》 - 从起源上解释人的本质，从根本上批判人类历史 《尤里叶-新的赫罗斯》《埃米尔-论教育》《社会契约论》 - 围绕同一个问题：人的天性怎样才能与他的国家、社会之中的存在及教育的必要性统一起来 发明 简谱 哲学研究对象 自我 思想 核心 我们应该从祖先的知识和所谓的文化艺术中解脱出来，回到无知、无辜、贫穷的状态 找回人的天性 最高原则不是理性，而是人的原始的东西，即感觉。 真理首先不是来自于思考，而是来自于感觉中，来自于直接的感知，要靠心灵去把握 人性本善 丑恶只是人的事情，由人的社会化引起的（社会存在应对丑恶负责） 伦理学 善良与丑恶的判断准则在人的心灵中 教育理论 核心 引导和促进儿童自身已有的善良天性的发展 目的 将人教育为独立自由的人，使他们从自身出发而生活和行动，让他们按照自己的能力掌握他们所碰到的一切 国家 国家的本质中有自由的可能 只有国家本身根植于自由中，人的自由与国家的限制才能统一 国家存在的根本基础应该是所有成员的自由联合（成为国民主权论的代言人） 具体表现 所有自由的人通过缔造契约建立国家 公民首先服从契约，然后只须服从自己的意志（用自然状态下时的无约束生活换取真正的自由-所有人受到法律约束时的自由） 自由（最具哲学意义） 方向 自由应该抛弃肆意的成分，将自己和法律联系起来。 服从自己制定的法律便是自由 Chapter 19 休谟——怀疑主义带来的沉船之难 大卫·休谟(D.Hume)（怀疑论者，经验主义者） 著作 《论人的天性》 《自然宗教对话》 认识 认识能力和理性不能把握真理 只有感官印象才是构成所有认识的基础，是认识的唯一直接的对象 哲学 中心任务 将所有的想象分解为直接的感官印象 自我 在本源上，没有一个统一的、可以把握的自我 自我本身不是感官印象 自我是一个特别的本体，像是一个高速变化中的意识内容的联合体 因果性 因果性 - 基于习惯和信仰的错觉 人的认识能力 理性不能认识真理 没有任何把握，应该放弃所有判断 Chapter 20 康德——准时的哲学 康德(Immanuel Kant) 生活 自我约束力强（准时，机械呆板） 安定从容 将真理公之于众不是人的义务 - 被责备言辞直率后作出让步 著作 Critique of Pure Reason Critique of Practical Reason Critique of Judgment 形而上学 人类真正的、永恒的幸福是建立于形而上学之上的 范围和任务 人生中绝对的无条件的东西是什么 现实存在中绝对的无条件的东西是什么 普遍的绝对的东西是什么 怀疑 原因 人的理性不能深入到可见的现实存在的背后发现它的根本原因（理性的本质） 认识 人所看到的现实是表象（并不是现实本身），依存于人所具有的特殊的认识能力（认识中最根本的一部分是由认识者主体本身的参与组成的） 意在探寻现实存在之外的形而上学方面的努力之所以失败的最终原因是形而上学本已超越人所具有的相应的认识范围 人的本质决定了人只有不断超越自我才能成为人 人能通过实践找到（理论范围内没有）那个无条件的、绝对的存在 哲学思辨 哲学思辨不是单纯地找到答案，然后一劳永逸，坐享其成 哲学思辨 - 不断提出生活现实中最本质的问题 Chapter 21 费希特——自由的叛逆 费西特(Fithe) 著作 《致德意志民族》 《科学论》 《幸福生活指南》 德国唯心主义的开端 真正存在着的，只有理念性的、精神性的东西，只有位于自由之中的自我 人的本质 感知上帝的存在，接受上帝的启迪 自由 起源 - 良心 自由的绝对性使现实存在和自我陷入虚无 生活在上帝中就是生活在自由中（放弃自由的绝对性） Chapter 22 谢林对“绝对”的钟爱 谢林(Schelling) 哲学思辨 出发点 - 人 理性直观 摆脱时间的变化和所有外来的东西回到自我的能力 “绝对” 哲学应该放弃从有限出发解释现实（把自己提高到“绝对”的立场） 神明 - 所有存在中发挥作用的内部规律 自然 - 一个完整独立的有机体 内部活力 - 贯穿整个自然的对立与矛盾 阶段 自然的无意识阶段 精神的意识阶段 自然和精神之外占统治地位的是具有创造力的神明 贯穿在自然和精神之中的，是上帝的自我实现，这一发展过程的终点是艺术 上帝 所有矛盾和对立的共同起源和共同目的（超越自然和精神、自我和非自我、主观和客观的存在） 现实为何不幸 上帝的发展是从两种原始的对立-黑暗的根源（如同上帝中的自然）和具有意识能力的神圣精神开始的 神明希望达到自身的统一（摆脱自我异化） 在统一的过程中，人可使用自由转向神圣，标志着欲望与精神在神明中开始重新和谐，有限的世界重新纳入无限中 Chapter 23 黑格尔——世界精神的化身 黑格尔 著作 《精神现象学》 哲学思辨 问题 包围我们的现实存在的深层是怎样的 以思考与行动的方式生活在这种现实存在中的人是怎样的 爱情的本质 - 在为对方放弃自我意识中重新获得和占有自我 出发点 - 上帝 基础 辩证法 根源 - 对具体现象的观察 辩证法是所有现实存在的一个本质结构 最基本的概念 上帝即绝对精神 绝对精神 上帝有一个历史的发展过程（有步骤地将自己的全部本质表现出来） 本质 - 一个不断变化的实体 人的精神是上帝表现自我的最完美的方式 人的精神最本质的特点 - 人能意识到自我 人的精神 - 自我意识（自我意识是发展变化着的辩证性的） 自我意识的三个发展阶段 第一阶段 - 简单的对自我存在的感觉 第二阶段 - 在观察自我中，自我发生异化（分成观察着的自我和被观察到的自我） 第三阶段 - 认识到异化的自我是同一个自我 上帝的精神的发展阶段 第一阶段 - 上帝没有意识到自身存在 第二阶段 - 上帝寻找自己，并自我异化为自然和人的精神 第三阶段 - 人的精神认识自然，上帝的自我得已回归 Chapter 24 叔本华——恶毒的眼光 叔本华(Schopenhauer) 生活（康德的学生） 悲观主义 -&gt; 自称“蔑视人类者”、“愤世嫉俗之人”，猜忌他人，蔑视女人 著作 《世界是意志与想象》 哲学思辨 出发点 - 对现实存在的悲观态度 人体表象背后的“自在之物” 本质 - 意志 世界即意志的自我认识 意志 - 一个统一的、原始的力量 人如何摆脱痛苦 第一阶段 - 观察事物的纯粹的本质，或者事物的“意念”（采取对世界与事物只进行单纯观察的态度） 意念是原始意志的纯洁的、先于现实存在的表现形式（原始意志首先在“意念”范围内得到实现，然后在可见的现实存在中表现出来） 艺术观察捕捉“意念” - 世界存在的最本质、最原始的东西，世界表象的真正的（不变的）内涵 艺术不能使人永久地从意志的束缚和它带来的痛苦中解脱出来（只能使人暂时地摆脱或忘记充满痛苦的自我） 第二阶段 - 从根本上否定引起痛苦的意志 人生而（有先于所有存在的先天秉性-理性秉性）自由 - 意志可被否定 如何否定意志 理论阶段 - 世界上所有痛苦的事情只是原始意志在自我斗争中引起的表象，其本身并非实际的 实践阶段 - 通过行动否定意志 主要是 - 通过同情减轻他人的痛苦 同情心是战胜利己主义的力量源泉 同情心体现在公正和仁爱中 伦理学 基本原则 - 丑恶源自利己，善良来自同情 Chapter 25 克尔凯廓尔——上帝的间谍 克尔凯廓尔(Kierkegaard) 生活 根本性格特征 - 悲戚伤感 父亲的经历，阻碍了，对达成婚姻的前提条件-以诚相见的信心，由此陷入自我折磨中 著作 《要么——要么》、《生活之路的阶段》、《哲学碎屑》、《论恐惧概念》、《恐惧与颤抖》、《死亡病》、《基督教入门》 真理 主观即真理 - 被人看作与自己的生存密切相关的认识才能成为真理 人的存在 人生的最基本的环境 - 人生活在对死亡的恐惧和绝望中 人的存在就是可能性的存在 人生阶段 第一阶段 - 美学阶段 - 不承担义务，满足于体验可能，就会感到生存的空虚，这样的生存在本质上是不真实的 第二阶段 - 道德阶段 - 通过具体的选择和决定真正找到自我，承担实现自我的任务 第三阶段 - 宗教阶段 - 敢于完全成为（纯粹的独特的）自我 宗教 基督教 信仰基督（并不是群体的运动）是每个狂热地追求自身永恒幸福的人的事情 - 严肃信仰 Chapter 26 费尔巴哈——人创造了上帝 费尔巴哈(Feuerbach) 生活 简朴整洁 著作 《基督教的本质》 哲学 研究对象 - 人 人本哲学 - 人的存在是唯一的、直接的现实存在 人的本质 - 感官性 精神或理性只是“感官性的本质，感官性的普遍统一” 感性是真理的驻地 无神论 核心 - 抛弃一切超感性的东西 上帝 本质 - 一个想象中、并不存在的幻想出来的东西被看成是现实的和实际存在的 神学的秘密是人类学 - 上帝的特征完全来自于人的自我认识和自我理解 人的依赖感（依赖世界和依赖自我）引起对人对上帝的信仰 从根本上决定人的思想与行动的是愿望，愿望的背后是对幸福的追求，上帝是在幻想中得到满足的人的幸福欲望 宗教和神学 基本原则 - 利己主义 信仰上帝寻求幸福是一种利己的自私的追求 Chapter 27 马克思——现实的反抗 马克思(Marx) 生活 弃诗从哲；几乎只听哲学历史方面的大学讲座；自学通过耶拿大学博士考试 著作 《资本论》第一二卷和部分第三卷 哲学 研究对象 - 人 现实人本主义 具体的现实就是人的现实 哲学是关于人的生存的学说 人的根源就是人本身 对人来说，第一位的、原始的现实就是人 人 从人的实践（具体活动）出发观察人 人必须通过实践证明真理，立即证明他的思维的正确性与现实性 思维应该从真正的、实践中的人出发 实践活动 特点 - 只能在人与人的结合中进行 人是社会动物（社会性） 人的社会存在决定其意识（出发点 - 人的社会性） 社会存在 第一位 - 共同的劳动 人是从事经济活动的主体 人的生存基础 - （经济关系赖以生存的）生产力 人的意识方式随经济关系的变化而变 人的意识方式通过“上层建筑”（包括国家、法律、思想、道德、艺术等）表现出来 经济关系的发展（辩证式的精神发展的规律在其中起着作用）是辩证式的，首先通过阶级的对立表现出来，历史是阶级斗争的历史 改变现实 人的“自我异化”（人的真正本质无法得到发挥） 经济关系 根源 - 劳动者和劳动产品的分离（劳动异化） 劳动异化导致人际关系的异化 共产主义 运动任务 - 消灭私有财产（消除人的自我异化） 本质 - 通过人将人的真正本质还给人 最终目的 - 彻底解决人与自然、人与人之间的矛盾，真正解决自由与必然间的冲突 Chapter 28 尼采——虚无主义的威力与无能 尼采(Nietzsche) 生活 异性交往 - 羞怯 婚姻 - 受妹妹挑拨而失败 著作 《论悲剧起源于音乐》 《萨拉图斯如是说》（自身写照） 精神的三个变化阶段 精神变成骆驼 - 崇拜信仰理想，耐心承担传统遗留下的重负 骆驼变成雄狮 - 信仰破灭，精神获得解放，顽强艰难地忍受由于信仰破灭而带来的虚无 雄狮变成儿童 - 肯定生活的天真无邪，建立新的信仰，战胜虚无 精神之路 第一步 - 崇拜过去遗留的文化财富，并让它们互相排斥，肩负所有的重担 第二步 - 在人们被束缚得最牢靠的时候，粉碎心灵对传统的崇拜 自由精神 首要任务 - 推翻传统的根深蒂固的偏见 第一方面 - 打碎对真理的信仰 第二方面 - 反抗道德（道德说教不可靠） 第三方面 - 抵制信仰上帝 第三步 - 对生活采取积极的态度，给予坚决的肯定（肯定生活的虚无主义本质） 重新创造道德 人（处于生活的伟大的创造过程中）的道路通向“新型的、更高级的人种”-“超人” 所有存在 基本特征 - 不断超越自我 本质 - 权力意志 世界 - 一种不可思议的力量的凝聚，无始无终，永不耗尽，而只能转变 名字 - 权力意志 虚无主义 极端表现形式 - 永恒循环 自由精神 - 在无意义中顽强地坚持创造意义 Chapter 29 雅斯柏斯——有益的失败 雅斯柏斯(Jaspers) 生活 基本心境 - 寂寞孤独 著作 《精神病理学》 - 认识人的可能性的极限 《世界观心理学》 - 通过心理学接近哲学 《哲学论》、《哲学逻辑》 - 人生问题 《时代的精神状况》 - 对人生的忧虑是解释时代的基础 哲学思辨 - 为我们自己操心（存在哲学） 人 天赋能力 - 自由 未来取决于人的责任感，取决于人的决定与行动（没有一个历史规律在整体上决定着事物发展的进程） - 基本哲学思想 自由只在实践中表现出来 - 自由通过自己的行动显示自己的存在 自由首先意味着人在所处环境中可以自由选择可能 自由更深一层的意义：人可以通过把握自己，达到自己的目的 - 伦理道德基础 极限困境 人从自我出发创造自己的生活是时，会意识到生存的界限 人的本质体现于极限困境中 人生最终面临的是颓丧，得不到丝毫安慰 - 虚无主义的绝望 办法 - 承认境遇，忍受状况 衡量自我存在及自由的最根本的标准 - 与他人的交往 每个人的自我存在只有在他人交往中，甚或只有在同唯一的一个人的交往中才可能实现 政治 核心问题 - 保障他人自由，并以此为基础正确确立人与人之间的互相交往 科学 义务 - 一直向极限的边缘进军（科学的进步与发展的极限根据其内部的必然性而言是不可避免的） 哲学信仰 - 对超验的信仰 人在面临失败的极限困境中会得到来自“超验”的帮助 哲学是“围绕着超验范围的旋转” 哲学信仰是所有哲学思辨不可缺少的根源 意义 表达无需天启的信仰，向走在同一条路上的人发出呼吁 把握方向 Chapter 30 海德格尔——一个有关于存在的神话 海德格尔(Heidegger) 生活 出生（居住）环境 - 黑森林和小城弗赖堡 - 眷恋大自然风光，钟爱黑森林一带的人民 秉性 - 迟缓谨慎，深邃抑郁 著作 《存在与时间》 - 从研究天主教神学和新康德主义开始逐渐形成思想体系 哲学 思想必须干涉和改变个人和社会生活 存在 最终目的 - 解决本体存在问题 存在就是“存在于是世界中” 人 任务 - 将自己从来自周围世界的普遍的制约中解脱出来，真正成为自我 存在 超验性 - 世界的存在基于人的参与 基本结构 - 时间性 人认识时间的根源，本质中的有限性的实现基础 时间之前 业已存在 现时存在 本体存在 不隐蔽，能被看到，处于光亮中 存在就是（在运动中）明显化（向外延伸）的过程 存在是动态积极的 存在必须从自身出发，重新面对误入歧途的人类，以便重新感知存在 办法 - 等待机会（存在的到来，位于存在的命运中） 世界 世界的显现基于对虚无的发现 虚无 虚无本身是主动积极的（虚无不是由人们引起的，而是虚无袭击战胜了人） -

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[IntroductionThe Wisdom of Insecurity : A Message for An Age of Anxiety - Alan W. Watts - 2011 ConnectionAlanWatts.org ExcerptChapter 1 The Age of AnxietyBy the same law of reversed effort, we discover the “infinite” and the “absolute,” not by straining to escape from the finite and relative world, but by the most complete acceptance of its limitations. Paradox as it may seem, we likewise find life meaningful only when we have seen that it is without purpose, and know the “mystery of the universe” only when we are convinced that we know nothing about it at all. accpet the limitation of the world and the human’s cognitive ability The discovery of the mystery, the wonder beyond all wonders, needs no belief, for we can only believe in what we have already known, preconceived, and imagined. But this is beyond any imagination. We have but to open the eyes of the mind wide enough, and “the truth will out.” believe in what we have already known, preconceived, and imagined Chapter 2 Pain and TimeThere is a price to be paid for every increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain. By remembering the past we can plan for the future. But the ability to plan for pleasure is offset by the “ability” to dread pain and to fear the unknown. Furthermore, the growth of an acute sense of the past and the future gives us a correspondingly dim sense of the present. In other words, we seem to reach a point where the advantages of being conscious are outweighed by its disadvantages, where extreme sensitivity makes us unadaptable. Of course we do not want to think that this is true. But it would be easy to show that most reasoning to the contrary is but wishful thinking—nature’s method of putting off suicide so that the idiocy can continue. Reasoning, then, is not enough. We must go deeper. We must look into this life, this nature, which has become aware within us, and find out whether it is really in conflict with itself, whether it actually desires the security and the painlessness which its individual forms can never enjoy. The life, the nature, which has become aware within us, only can choose the mixture of the pleasure and the pain or the mixture of the security and the painlessness. Chapter 3 The Great StreamFor to define is to isolate, to separate some complex of forms from the stream of life and say, “This is I.” When man can name and define himself, he feels that he has an identity. Thus he begins to feel, like the word, separate and static, as over against the real, fluid world of nature. Of course there is nothing new in this predicament of discovering that ideas and words cannot plumb the ultimate mystery of life, that Reality or, if you will, God cannot be comprehended by the finite mind. The only novelty is that the predicament is now social rather than individual; it is widely felt, not confined to the few. Almost every spiritual tradition recognizes that a point comes when two things must happen: man must surrender his separate-feeling “I,” and must face the fact that he cannot know, that is, define the ultimate. surrender the separate-feeling “I,” and face the fact that humans cannot define the ultimate Chapter 4 The Wisdom of the BodyWorking rightly, the brain is the highest form of “instinctual wisdom.” Thus it should work like the homing instinct of pigeons and the formation of the foetus in the womb—without verbalizing the process or knowing “how” it does it. The self-conscious brain, like the self-conscious heart, is a disorder, and manifests itself in the acute feeling of separation between “I” and my experience. The brain can only assume its proper behavior when consciousness is doing what it is designed for: not writhing and whirling to get out of present experience, but being effortlessly aware of it. Being effortlessly aware of the present experience Chapter 5 On Being AwareThe real reason why human life can be so utterly exasperating and frustrating is not because there are facts called death, pain, fear, or hunger. The madness of the thing is that when such facts are present, we circle, buzz, writhe, and whirl, trying to get the “I” out of the experience. We pretend that we are amoebas, and try to protect ourselves from life by splitting in two. Sanity, wholeness, and integration lie in the realization that we are not divided, that man and his present experience are one, and that no separate “I” or mind can be found. The man and his present experience are one. Chapter 6 The Marvelous MomentIn the light of these principles, how does the mind absorb suffering? It discovers that resistance and escape—the “I” process—is a false move. The pain is inescapable, and resistance as a defense only makes it worse; the whole system is jarred by the shock. Seeing the impossibility of this course, it must act according to its nature—remain stable and absorb. To remain stable is to refrain from trying to separate yourself from a pain because you know that you cannot. Running away from fear is fear, fighting pain is pain, trying to be brave is being scared. If the mind is in pain, the mind is pain. The thinker has no other form than his thought. There is no escape. But so long as you are not aware of the inseparability of thinker and thought, you will try to escape. From this follows, quite naturally, absorption. It is no effort; the mind does it by itself. Seeing that there is no escape from the pain, the mind yields to it, absorbs it, and becomes conscious of just pain without any “I” feeling it or resisting it. It experiences pain in the same complete, unselfconscious way in which it experiences pleasure. Pain is the nature of this present moment, and I can only live in this moment. Sometimes, when resistance ceases, the pain simply goes away or dwindles to an easily tolerable ache. At other times it remains, but the absence of any resistance brings about a way of feeling pain so unfamiliar as to be hard to describe. The pain is no longer problematic. I feel it, but there is no urge to get rid of it, for I have discovered that pain and the effort to be separate from it are the same thing. Wanting to get out of pain is the pain; it is not the “reaction” of an “I” distinct from the pain. When you discover this, the desire to escape “merges” into the pain itself and vanishes. It is the same with thinking, which is really silent talking. It is not, by itself, open to the discovery of anything new, for its only novelties are simply rearrangements of old words and ideas. We learn nothing of very much importance when it can be explained entirely in terms of past experience. If it were possible to understand all things in terms of what we know already, we could convey the sense of color to a blind man with nothing but sound, taste, touch, and smell. If we are open only to discoveries which will accord with what we know already, we may as well stay shut. Tools such as these, as well as the tools of language and thought, are of real use to men only if they are awake—not lost in the dreamland of past and future, but in the closest touch with that point of experience where reality can alone be discovered: this moment. Here life is alive, vibrant, vivid, and present, containing depths which we have hardly begun to explore. But to see and understand it at all, the mind must not be divided into “I” and “this experience.” The moment must be what it always is—all that you are and all that you know. In this house there is no room for thee and me! Learning needs past experience and awareness. get the closest touch with this moment mind must not be divided into “I” and “this experience” Chapter 7 The Transformation of LifeNothing is more creative than death, since it is the whole secret of life. It means that the past must be abandoned, that the unknown cannot be avoided, that “I” cannot continue, and that nothing can be ultimately fixed. When a man knows this, he lives for the first time in his life. By holding his breath, he loses it. By letting it go he finds it. Death tells the man that the past must be abandoned, that the unknown cannot be avoided, that “I” cannot continue, and that nothing can be ultimately fixed, and he should let it go. Chapter 8 Creative MoralityThe meaning of freedom can never be grasped by the divided mind. If I feel separate from my experience, and from the world, freedom will seem to be the extent to which I can push the world around, and fate the extent to which the world pushes me around. But to the whole mind there is no contrast of “I” and the world. There is just one process acting, and it does everything that happens. It raises my little finger and it creates earthquakes. Or, if you want to put it that way, I raise my little finger and also make earthquakes. No one fates and no one is being fated. But there is no formula for generating the authentic warmth of love. It cannot be copied. You cannot talk yourself into it or rouse it by straining at the emotions or by dedicating yourself solemnly to the service of mankind. Everyone has love, but it can only come out when he is convinced of the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself. This conviction will not come through condemnations, through hating oneself, through calling self-love all the bad names in the universe. It comes only in the awareness that one has no self to love. A man’s love can only come out when he accepts the impossibility and the frustration of trying to love himself. A man’s love can not be separated from himself. Chapter 9 Religion ReviewedIn such a confession thought has moved full circle, and we are again as children. To those still feverishly intent upon explaining all things, upon securing the water of life firmly in paper and string, this confession says nothing and means nothing but defeat. To others, the fact that thought has completed a circle is a revelation of what man has been doing, not only in philosophy, religion, and speculative science, but also in psychology and morals, in everyday feeling and living. His mind has been in a whirl to be away from itself and to catch itself. Ye suffer from yourselves, none else compels,None other holds you that ye live and dieAnd whir upon the wheel, and hug and kissits spokes of agony,Its tire of tears, its nave of nothingness. Discovering this the mind becomes whole: the split between I and me, man and the world, the ideal and the real, comes to an end. Paranoia, the mind beside itself, becomes metanoia, the mind with itself and so free from itself. Free from clutching at themselves the hands can handle; free from looking after themselves the eyes can see; free from trying to understand itself thought can think. In such feeling, seeing, and thinking life requires no future to complete itself nor explanation to justify itself. In this moment it is finished. The life requires no future to complete itself nor explanation to justify itself.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[IntroductionThe_C_Programming_Language-Brian Kernighan &amp; Dennis Ritchie-2nd Edition ExcerptChapter 11.8 Arguments - Call by ValueThe called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables - leads to more compact programswith fewer extraneous variables the called function can’t modify a variable in a calling routine. the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable) the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the variable indirectly through it. the called functino can modify a variable in a calling routine. The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument of the array. Chapter 4 Functions and Program Structure4.7 Register VariablesIt is not possible to take the address of a register variable (a topic covered in Chapter 5), regardless of whether the variable is actually placed in a register. The specific restrictions on number and types of register variables vary from machine to machine. 4.8 Block StructureAn automatic variable declared and initialized in a block is initialized each time the block is entered. But the static variables are initialized once only at the first time of entering the block. 4.9 InitializationIn the absence of explicit initialization, external and static variables are guaranteed to be initialized to zero; automatic and register variables have undefined (i.e., garbage) initial values.Scalar variables may be initialized when they are defined, by following the name with an equals sign and an expression:123int x = 1;char squota = &apos;\&apos;&apos;;long day = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L; /* milliseconds/day */ For external and static variables, the initializer must be a constant expression; the initialization is done once, conceptionally before the program begins execution. For automatic and register variables, the initializer is not restricted to being a constant: it may be any expression involving previously defined values, even function calls. 4.10 RecursionThe digits are generated in the wrong order: low-order digits are available before high-order digits. 4.11 The C PreprocessorThe two most frequently used features are #include, to include the contents of a file during compilation, and #define, to replace a token by an arbitrary sequence of characters.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[IntroductionA HISTORY OF WESTERN THOUGHT - Gunnar Skirbekk &amp; Nils Gilje （西方哲学史-从古希腊到当下-希尔贝克-修订版-上海译文出版社 20160301) SummaryChapter 1 前苏格拉底哲学，附带浏览古代印度思想和古代中国思想Section 1 古希腊城邦-共同体中的人 理解答案，需把握特定哲学家的问题和用来支持其答案的论据。 一般来说，哲学答案的重要性不在于“运用”，而在于有助于我们更好地理解事物。 不同的答案具有不同的蕴意，对哲学问题可以有不同的实际影响。所以我们有必要意识到一种哲学答案会具有什么样的蕴意。 我们必需意识的东西有四点：1.问题；2.论据；3.答案（最不重要，其意义基于特定因素）；4.蕴意。 米利都派的自然哲学家（第一代，追问贯穿所有变化中的不变的元素是什么） 泰勒斯(Thales)：（据说）万物是水。（所有变化中存在一种不变的元素。） 阿纳克西曼德(Anaximander)：始基，不定者，它是空间上和时间上都没有边界的。 阿纳克西米尼(Anaximenes)：（水从自己的未分化的状态转变为它的种种分化的状态，是如何发生的）气是始基。 第二代（提出质问：变化是否存在) 赫拉克利特(Heraclitus)：万物处于不断的变化或流动中。 万物处于流到状态中，但是 变化是根据一种不变的规律(logos)发生的，并且 这种规律包含了对立面的相互作用 但是这种对立面相互作用的方式，作为一个整体创造出了和谐。 巴门尼德(Parmenides)：变化在逻辑上是不可能的，没有任何东西是在变化的状态中的。 第三代（居间） 恩培多克勒(Empedocles)：四个不可变化的原始实体-火、气、水和土；两种力量-起分裂作用的力量（恨）和起统一作用的力量（爱）（变化和力量不是内在于原始实体中）。 阿那克萨格拉(Anaxagoras)：无数元素；一种力量-心灵(nous) 德谟克利特(Democritus)：只存在一种始基：不可分割的微小粒子（原子(atomos)）。它们在空虚中运动（虚空），它们的运动仅受机械方面的规定（机械决定论）。 毕达格拉斯学派(the Pythagoreans)：自然之门可用数学“打开” 数学结构是所有事物的基础（是实体）。 对和声学的研究表明，在数学和像音乐这样非物质的东西之间也有一种对应。 毕达格拉斯定理表明，数学也是可以运用于物质事物的。 天体的据说是圆形的运动，意味着这些物体也是服从数学的。 数学是自然中的不变者。 事物会毁坏，但数学概念却不会毁坏。 数学知识是确定的。 数学定理是逻辑上被证明的。 双重意义上的理性主义者： 提出以数学证明的形式出现的理性论据。 相信实在是在“基于”所有感性现象之上的数学形式当中发现的，是通过理性而不是感官而获得关于实在的知识的。 Section 2 古代印度思想和古代中国思想之一瞥Chapter 2 智者派和苏格拉底Section 1 智者派Section 2 苏格拉底Chapter 3 柏拉图——理念论和理想国Section 1 知识和存在Section 2 柏拉图的《理想国》和善Section 3 艺术的伦理责任Chapter 4 亚里士多德——自然秩序和作为“政治动物”的人Section 1 理念或实体Section 2 本体论和认识论Section 3 亚里士多德和生态学Section 4 知识和实践Section 5 艺术——摹仿和净化Chapter 5 后期古典时期Section 1 确保个体幸福Section 2 伊壁鸠鲁主义——确保个人安康Section 3 斯多葛学派——确保个人幸福Section 4 新柏拉图主义Section 5 怀疑论Section 6 古代的科学和其他学科Chapter 6 中世纪Section 1 基督教和哲学Section 2 教皇和国王——一国两主Section 3 教皇和国王——一国两主Section 4 共相的问题，以及经院学派Section 5 托马斯·阿奎那——调和与综合Section 6 帕多瓦的马西略和奥卡姆的威廉——从综合到怀疑论Section 7 马丁·路德——意志主义和唯名论： 惟有信仰Section 8 大学传统Section 9 阿拉伯哲学和科学Chapter 7 自然科学的兴起Section 1 方法之争Section 2 天文学——哥白尼和开普勒Section 3 物理学——伽利略和牛顿Section 4 生物科学Section 5 作为主体的人Chapter 8 文艺复兴与现实政治——马基雅弗利和霍布斯Section 1 马基雅弗利——作为权术的政治Section 2 基于契约的政治和基于自然法的政治——阿尔特胡修斯和格劳修斯Section 3 霍布斯——个人和自保Chapter 9 怀疑和信念——处于中心的人Section 1 笛卡儿——有条理的怀疑和对理性的信赖Section 2 帕斯卡尔——人心的理性Section 3 维科——作为一个模式的历史Chapter 10 作为一个体系的唯理论Section 1 斯宾诺莎——神即自然Section 2 莱布尼兹——单子和先定的和谐Chapter 11 洛克——启蒙和平等Section 1 认识论和知识批判Section 2 政治理论——个人及其权利Chapter 12 经验主义与知识批判Section 1 贝克莱——对经验主义的内部批判Section 2 休谟——作为批判主义的经验主义Chapter 13 启蒙运动、自由主义和功利主义Section 1 启蒙运动——理性和进步Section 2 对启蒙运动的逆反Section 3 经济自由主义Section 4 功利主义——功利计算和法律改革Section 5 社会自由主义，以及作为合理性的一个条件的自由Section 6 政治自由主义Chapter 14 康德——哲学中的“哥白尼式的革命”Section 1 先验哲学——认识论Section 2 先验哲学——道德理论Section 3 政治理论Section 4 判断力——目的论和美学Chapter 15 人文学科的兴起Section 1 背景Section 2 赫尔德和历史主义Section 3 施莱尔马赫和诠释学Section 4 历史学派——冯·萨维尼和冯·兰克Section 5 德罗伊森和狄尔泰——人文学科的独特性Section 6 历史学派的解体Chapter 16 黑格尔——历史和辩证法Section 1 反思，辩证法和经验Section 2 主人与奴隶——为了承认和社会认同而进行的斗争Section 3 作为理性的传统——普遍和特殊之间的张力Section 4 家庭、市民社会和国家Section 5 评论和回应——对黑格尔的种种责难Chapter 17 马克思——生产力和阶级斗争Section 1 辩证法和异化Section 2 历史唯物主义Section 3 生产力和生产关系Section 4 剩余价值和剥削Section 5 评论和回应——对马克思的种种责难Section 6 恩格斯——从马克思主义视角考察家庭Chapter 18 克尔恺郭尔——生存和反讽Section 1 直接交往和生存交往Section 2 生命道路的三个阶段Section 3 主观性即真理Section 4 民主政治是蛊惑民心Chapter 19 关于我们对人的看法的争论Section 1 达尔文——遗产和自然选择Section 2 尼采——上帝之死Section 3 弗洛伊德和无意识Chapter 20 社会主义和法西斯主义Section 1 共产主义——列宁： 政党和国家Section 2 社会民主主义——社会福利和议会主义Section 3 法西斯主义——民族主义和秩序Section 4 现代国家的意义——弗朗西斯·福山Section 5 政治化的宗教——作为传统和现代性之奇异结合的伊斯兰教Chapter 21 社会科学的兴起Section 1 背景Section 2 奥古斯特·孔德——社会学的“大祭司”Section 3 托克维尔——论美国的民主Section 4 费迪南·滕尼斯——共同体和社会Section 5 格奥尔格·西美尔——社会组织Section 6 爱弥尔·涂尔干——社会和社会凝聚力Section 7 马克斯·韦伯——合理性和“英雄式的悲观主义”Section 8 塔尔科特·帕森斯——行动和功能Chapter 22 自然科学的新进展Section 1 爱因斯坦和现代物理学Section 2 科学分叉和技术发展——科学的应用和跨学科的进路Chapter 23 当代哲学概观Section 1 实用主义——最好在共同体内部寻求知识Section 2 逻辑实证主义——逻辑与经验主义Section 3 卡尔·波普尔和“批判理性主义”Section 4 托马斯·库恩——科学中的范式转换Section 5 路德维希·维特根斯坦——作为实践的分析哲学Sectino 6 日常语言哲学和言语行为理论——奥斯丁和塞尔Section 7 现象学和存在主义——胡塞尔和萨特Section 8 认同和承认——西蒙·德·波伏娃与女性主义哲学Chapter 24 现代性和危机Section 1 现代性之批判Section 2 马丁·海德格尔——经由诗艺Section 3 汉娜·阿伦特——积极生活(Vita Activa)Section 4 加达默尔——诠释学传统Section 5 德里达、福柯和罗蒂——解构和批判Section 6 于尔根·哈贝马斯——经由论辩]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Introduction观念的水位-刘瑜-浙江大学出版社-201301 Summary观念·此处素质公民素养的培养首先需要制度的变革打开公共空间。 民意与伪民意鉴定民意的真伪，标准在于民众在形成意见时讨论是否自由、观念可否多元、信息是否充分。 给理想一点时间相信时间，就意味着相信除了千千万万人日积月累的努力，历史没有进步的捷径。 不知道与宁可不知道“理性无知”理论：当“无知”合乎人们的“理性”时，人们可能会努力保持这种无知，刻意逃避可能会干扰这种“无知”的信息。 恶之平庸犯下恶行者，因看不到与所犯恶行相关的一系列事件的全貌，似乎都有理由觉得自己无辜。 所谓人性觉醒，就是从自己所隐身的角色中抽身出来，恢复成独立、完整并需要为自己一举一动负责的人。 贵族范儿一个道理的意义不在于它能创造多少美学上的新鲜感或者提供多少智力上的游戏感，而在于它在多大程度上回应现实中的真问题。（道理的意义在于回应现实中的真问题。） 迷人的愤怒愤怒是通向正义感进而达成“存在感”的捷径。 对很多掌权者而言，民众的愤怒是最好的政治兴奋剂。 施密特：政治的要义是“分清敌我”。 肩负自由的疲惫民众对政府的不信任促进政府被改造得更加值得信任。 民众对政府一定的信任是政府健康的表现。 告别印象主义不要印象主义。(逻辑和论据不可能说清所有社会问题，但有存在意义。) 今天您施密特了吗不要施密特中国粉丝团文风。（诉诸强力的前提是对话空间已被开拓和穷尽。） 弹性的限度解除政治悲剧应着眼于权力的结构，而不是政策的创新。 怎样推销“糖果”在现代社会里，只有决策透明、民主、科学，才合乎程序正义。 标签战标签的意义在于屏蔽而不是展开思考。 标签战伤害道理的微妙性。 标签战源于认知懒惰。 标签战伤害公共理性。 没来的请举手知识有三种：你知道的，你不知道的，你不知道自己不知道的。 保持对被遮蔽的世界的知觉。 法治何以可能权利的前提本质上是权力。 法治有意义的前提是权力平衡。 他也可以是我康德:道德准则的存在基于普适性。 人权观念的伦理基础是博爱。 博爱的起点是自爱，自爱加同理心成为博爱。 合同异否认量变的差异，就是否认了进步的可能性和必要性。 权力的道德捆绑将道德和权力捆绑，是动员民众加入政治斗争的统治策略。 观念的水位观念水位变化的重要标志之一是以前民众眼中不是问题的问题开始变成问题了。 民主的观念基础：问责意识和权利意识。 观念·别处倒霉的英国议员信息公开不能仅靠领导人的“决心”，还需要依赖媒体自由、政党角逐、权力制衡等机制来将信息公开的权力从领导人手中转移到他人手中。 提问时间到官员既无需风度也无需知识的国家里，官员的日子也许好过了，民众的日子则不一定。 过去的怎样让它过去诚恳反思过去的核心意义是在直面历史的基础上实现真正的和解与稳定。 沉默罪独立于权势的法庭应同时独立于民愤，否则无以平衡权势。 大家一起来算账政治辩论应集中于具体政策。 敲开最好的可能一个正常社会往往缺少的不是人的善意，而是引导善意流向弱势群体的中间人。 政治敲开人性的可能性。 让政治变得家常政府最应做的事是提供服务。 民主的裤衩权力制衡制度的最大好处是其自我纠错机制。 吵吵更健康因为自由反哺观念的多样性，民主的质量很大程度上依赖于思想的自由。 苏东巨变：二十年之后同步性未必意味着因果性。 政治转型不是直线过程。 俄罗斯的徘徊民主的存在意义基于自由。 当“革命”成为家常便饭民主制度需要民众对政治长期监督。 有亚洲特色的民主制度大于出身是民主的要义。 当民主缺失中产阶级程序正义是现代政治的根基。 历史螺旋式终结福山：自由民主制度迟早会成为人类政治文明的终结状态。 选举式独裁政治制度的健康基于制衡。 只注重垂直呼应民意而忽视水平制衡的政府也许合法但不合理。 宪法这只兔子手握政权者对宪法的控制力体现政治的质量。 我们在输出什么政治和经济相互渗透，两者的发展都需考虑相互间的影响。 有多少资本主义可以重来？允许民众自由表达观念和利益的制度促成民主制度的纠错弹性。 经济活力和社会凝聚力，二者不可缺一。 新自由主义的两种命运国家引进自由经济制度时，还需对政治、法律、福利政策方面改革，通过经济自由实现发展，通过政治民主保障公平。 从更人道的到更霸道的福利是个体责任，而非集体权力。 书幸福的与被幸福的当统治者的恩赐被视为民众幸福的源泉时，统治者越高大，民众越渺小。 当他们开始用脚投票行动胜于雄辩。 成圣又如何思想资源决定意识形态，意识形态决定游戏规则。 红旗未曾下过这只蛋读史，不拘泥于其中，然后反思。 那个搬起石头砸自己脚的人推动时代的更迭，需要个人的牺牲。 底线时分无底线者让人鄙夷。 超越那些“想当然”思考结果以及过程，思考他人以及自己。 当自由遭遇一丝微风言论自由是一切自由的基础。 政权的言行不一致使其权力衰竭。 在黑暗中消失之前人的尊严可以不屈于黑暗。 重新发现我们自己国家与社会可以相辅相成。 法治的“秘密”法治源自权力机构的价值自觉和实践。 民众的“素质”很大程度上取决于国家机构本身的“素质”。 你比你想象得更自由兰德：道德只建立在个体理性的基础上，其基础不该是任何宗教、情感、社会、国家、阶级以及任何形式的集体。 诸善之间不只“善”与“恶”，“善”之间也可构成紧张关系。 像一滴水一样高华：毛时代的思想改造“配方”-资源的垄断式供给+全面改写历史前提下的信息封闭与观念灌输+在群体中孤立个体+强力威胁；以及这种“思想改造”外科手术般的“程序”：封闭的学习文件-&gt;组织群体对个体进行批评与攻击-&gt;自我羞辱式的检查与“交心”-&gt;必要时的惩罚甚至暴力惩罚-&gt;纠编阶段受害者的感激涕零。 为了过去，还原历史的本来面目。 从经典到经验经典的价值不在于他人的赞美，而在于是否能帮助你认识你所置身的世界与自己。 真正的好书都向证伪敞开，而不是给你一个一劳永逸的启示。 电影愿像那水中浮木一个人占有得越多，就被占有得越多。 快乐的可能剥夺快乐的权利，或会扭曲人性。 对快乐的渴望，保留挽救人性的希望。 如此优雅的平庸诗意无法拯救平庸。 没有你们就没有他们人可为趋利避害而抛弃信念。 物质基础也可被上层建筑改造。 语言的贫困思想的钳制造就语言的饥荒，但语言的饥荒也恶化思想的贫困。 一个政权的专制程度，总和它的词语丰富程度成反比。 爱是True love is love for humanity. 善的理由人需从生命的虚空中打捞“善”的意义。 “善”不只是求生策略。 回到巴黎和你的梦想和你所想象的自己有关的，才是你的故乡。 剩下的琥珀之城保护历史遗迹。 历史融入生活。 严肃对待小事。 尊重规则秩序。 充满好奇心。 另一个高度舍去身份，追上自由。 请别让我消失人生的虚空让人恐惧。 兔子跑什么跑逃避自我，寻求爱情，但爱情不可填补自我这个深渊。 最好的时光以沉默守护青春。 诗的世界在每一个角落里等待更少地生活以便于更好地生活，减少与生活的接触面有利于在有限的面积上精耕细作。 记得当年草上飞在时间面前，我们能指望的，大约只是以生的优雅抚慰它的渺小。 在死亡的强光中可以绝望，但不要唠叨绝望。 论时尚时尚该是在一切随波逐流前逆行。 写给末日“末日”的意义在于给我们一个机会，去审视自我是否活在此时此地。 那些剩下的东西灵魂的差异间接肯定了自由意志。]]></content>

    <url>%2F2017%2F09%2F27%2F2017-09-27-Known_Proofs_You_Can_Increase_Your_Brain_Power%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Known1. Reading trains the brain.Oxford scientists proved that the process of reading trains the cognitive abilities of the brain. It also activates areas that aren’t used at other times. While reading, blood enters the brain areas responsible for concentrate and cognition. It’s noteworthy that this effect doesn’t occur when watching TV or playing computer games. 2. Painting improves the work of the brain.Painting and contemplations of works of art improve the interaction between brain areas while slowing its aging. 3. Romantic love and maternal feelings are very similar.According to brain activity, romantic relationships and maternal feelings are very similar, but there are differences as well. For example, passionate love activates the brain areas related to sexual arousal. In addition, the feeling of anxiety and fear decreases, and the feeling of euphoria increases. Maternal love activates the areas responsible for the formation of affection. 4. The abundance of sugar in the diet worsens memory and reduces the ability to learn.The abundant of fructose in the diet slows down the brain and reduces its ability to learn, remember information, and concentrate. This is because the excess sugar destroys neural connections in the brain. Scientists emphasize that industrially produced sugar is much more harmful(Add to soft drinks, seasonings, sauces, and baby food). However, products containing Omega-3 fatty acids(such as fatty fish, nuts, and fish oil) remove the consequences of the disorder. 5. Pregnancy changes the brain’s structure.Pregnancy reduces the amount of gray matter in the brain areas responsible for social cognition and the ability to understand other people. All of it is necessary to strengthen the mother-baby connection, help a woman understand the need of her child, and notice possible external dangers. 6. The brain is sensitive to dehydration.Our brain is almost 80% water. Therefore, even a moderate loss of fluid(about 2%) reduces concentration and vigilance and leads to deterioration of short-term memory and other cognitive abilities. 7. Love and hate have a lot in common.Love and hate originate in similar brain areas. However, unlike hatred, love significantly reduces the activity of the areas responsible for judgment and logical thinking. 8. Prolonged stress destroys the brain.A decrease in memory, in the ability to learn, in self-control – these are the consequences that chronic stress is fraught with.Also, it contributes to a person feeling irritation, anxiety, tension, and often being distracted. 9. Chronic lack of sleep worsens memory.During a full night’s sleep, brain cells remove toxic compounds dangerous for our brain. If a person never gets enough sleep, it has a devastating effect on their brain cells.

Choose two ways, learning small blocks of knowledge one by one for full study, or learning key knowledge for quick study. Explain the knowledge points with the original knowledge after learning. Compare your presentation and information. Repeat step 3 to 4 for knowledge loopholes. [Summary]The learning process is to constantly use the old knowledge to explain the new knowledge and transform them into old knowledge.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[ReminderIf you want a good sleep, please go on. PreparationBreath out completely through your mouth. Instructions Breath in quietly through your nose for 4 seconds. Hold your breath for 7 seconds. Breath out through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for four “cycles”. Hint Practice at least twice a day. To help fall asleep, practice when you get in bed or if you wake in the night. If you’re feeling stressed or feel like you need to settle your nerves, practice to get a “hit” of calm. You may feel a little light headed when you begin. It will pass as you practice. After a month you may want to extend to 8 cycles.Effects are subtle to begin but increase with repetition. It takes about 2 months of practice to get best results.]]></content>
