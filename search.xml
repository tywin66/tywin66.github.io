    <content type="text"><![CDATA[IntroductionA HISTORY OF WESTERN THOUGHT - Gunnar Skirbekk &amp; Nils Gilje （西方哲学史-从古希腊到当下-希尔贝克-修订版-上海译文出版社 20160301) SummaryChapter 1 前苏格拉底哲学，附带浏览古代印度思想和古代中国思想Section 1 古希腊城邦-共同体中的人 理解答案，需把握特定哲学家的问题和用来支持其答案的论据。 一般来说，哲学答案的重要性不在于“运用”，而在于有助于我们更好地理解事物。 不同的答案具有不同的蕴意，对哲学问题可以有不同的实际影响。所以我们有必要意识到一种哲学答案会具有什么样的蕴意。 我们必需意识的东西有四点：1.问题；2.论据；3.答案（最不重要，其意义基于特定因素）；4.蕴意。 米利都派的自然哲学家（第一代，追问贯穿所有变化中的不变的元素是什么） 泰勒斯(Thales)：（据说）万物是水。（所有变化中存在一种不变的元素。） 阿纳克西曼德(Anaximander)：始基，不定者，它是空间上和时间上都没有边界的。 阿纳克西米尼(Anaximenes)：（水从自己的未分化的状态转变为它的种种分化的状态，是如何发生的）气是始基。 第二代（提出质问：变化是否存在) 赫拉克利特(Heraclitus)：万物处于不断的变化或流动中。 万物处于流到状态中，但是 变化是根据一种不变的规律(logos)发生的，并且 这种规律包含了对立面的相互作用 但是这种对立面相互作用的方式，作为一个整体创造出了和谐。 巴门尼德(Parmenides)：变化在逻辑上是不可能的，没有任何东西是在变化的状态中的。 第三代（居间） 恩培多克勒(Empedocles)：四个不可变化的原始实体-火、气、水和土；两种力量-起分裂作用的力量（恨）和起统一作用的力量（爱）（变化和力量不是内在于原始实体中）。 阿那克萨格拉(Anaxagoras)：无数元素；一种力量-心灵(nous) 德谟克利特(Democritus)：只存在一种始基：不可分割的微小粒子（原子(atomos)）。它们在空虚中运动（虚空），它们的运动仅受机械方面的规定（机械决定论）。 毕达格拉斯学派(the Pythagoreans)：自然之门可用数学“打开” 数学结构是所有事物的基础（是实体）。 对和声学的研究表明，在数学和像音乐这样非物质的东西之间也有一种对应。 毕达格拉斯定理表明，数学也是可以运用于物质事物的。 天体的据说是圆形的运动，意味着这些物体也是服从数学的。 数学是自然中的不变者。 事物会毁坏，但数学概念却不会毁坏。 数学知识是确定的。 数学定理是逻辑上被证明的。 双重意义上的理性主义者： 提出以数学证明的形式出现的理性论据。 相信实在是在“基于”所有感性现象之上的数学形式当中发现的，是通过理性而不是感官而获得关于实在的知识的。 Section 2 古代印度思想和古代中国思想之一瞥Chapter 2 智者派和苏格拉底Section 1 智者派Section 2 苏格拉底Chapter 3 柏拉图——理念论和理想国Section 1 知识和存在Section 2 柏拉图的《理想国》和善Section 3 艺术的伦理责任Chapter 4 亚里士多德——自然秩序和作为“政治动物”的人Section 1 理念或实体Section 2 本体论和认识论Section 3 亚里士多德和生态学Section 4 知识和实践Section 5 艺术——摹仿和净化Chapter 5 后期古典时期Section 1 确保个体幸福Section 2 伊壁鸠鲁主义——确保个人安康Section 3 斯多葛学派——确保个人幸福Section 4 新柏拉图主义Section 5 怀疑论Section 6 古代的科学和其他学科Chapter 6 中世纪Section 1 基督教和哲学Section 2 教皇和国王——一国两主Section 3 教皇和国王——一国两主Section 4 共相的问题，以及经院学派Section 5 托马斯·阿奎那——调和与综合Section 6 帕多瓦的马西略和奥卡姆的威廉——从综合到怀疑论Section 7 马丁·路德——意志主义和唯名论： 惟有信仰Section 8 大学传统Section 9 阿拉伯哲学和科学Chapter 7 自然科学的兴起Section 1 方法之争Section 2 天文学——哥白尼和开普勒Section 3 物理学——伽利略和牛顿Section 4 生物科学Section 5 作为主体的人Chapter 8 文艺复兴与现实政治——马基雅弗利和霍布斯Section 1 马基雅弗利——作为权术的政治Section 2 基于契约的政治和基于自然法的政治——阿尔特胡修斯和格劳修斯Section 3 霍布斯——个人和自保Chapter 9 怀疑和信念——处于中心的人Section 1 笛卡儿——有条理的怀疑和对理性的信赖Section 2 帕斯卡尔——人心的理性Section 3 维科——作为一个模式的历史Chapter 10 作为一个体系的唯理论Section 1 斯宾诺莎——神即自然Section 2 莱布尼兹——单子和先定的和谐Chapter 11 洛克——启蒙和平等Section 1 认识论和知识批判Section 2 政治理论——个人及其权利Chapter 12 经验主义与知识批判Section 1 贝克莱——对经验主义的内部批判Section 2 休谟——作为批判主义的经验主义Chapter 13 启蒙运动、自由主义和功利主义Section 1 启蒙运动——理性和进步Section 2 对启蒙运动的逆反Section 3 经济自由主义Section 4 功利主义——功利计算和法律改革Section 5 社会自由主义，以及作为合理性的一个条件的自由Section 6 政治自由主义Chapter 14 康德——哲学中的“哥白尼式的革命”Section 1 先验哲学——认识论Section 2 先验哲学——道德理论Section 3 政治理论Section 4 判断力——目的论和美学Chapter 15 人文学科的兴起Section 1 背景Section 2 赫尔德和历史主义Section 3 施莱尔马赫和诠释学Section 4 历史学派——冯·萨维尼和冯·兰克Section 5 德罗伊森和狄尔泰——人文学科的独特性Section 6 历史学派的解体Chapter 16 黑格尔——历史和辩证法Section 1 反思，辩证法和经验Section 2 主人与奴隶——为了承认和社会认同而进行的斗争Section 3 作为理性的传统——普遍和特殊之间的张力Section 4 家庭、市民社会和国家Section 5 评论和回应——对黑格尔的种种责难Chapter 17 马克思——生产力和阶级斗争Section 1 辩证法和异化Section 2 历史唯物主义Section 3 生产力和生产关系Section 4 剩余价值和剥削Section 5 评论和回应——对马克思的种种责难Section 6 恩格斯——从马克思主义视角考察家庭Chapter 18 克尔恺郭尔——生存和反讽Section 1 直接交往和生存交往Section 2 生命道路的三个阶段Section 3 主观性即真理Section 4 民主政治是蛊惑民心Chapter 19 关于我们对人的看法的争论Section 1 达尔文——遗产和自然选择Section 2 尼采——上帝之死Section 3 弗洛伊德和无意识Chapter 20 社会主义和法西斯主义Section 1 共产主义——列宁： 政党和国家Section 2 社会民主主义——社会福利和议会主义Section 3 法西斯主义——民族主义和秩序Section 4 现代国家的意义——弗朗西斯·福山Section 5 政治化的宗教——作为传统和现代性之奇异结合的伊斯兰教Chapter 21 社会科学的兴起Section 1 背景Section 2 奥古斯特·孔德——社会学的“大祭司”Section 3 托克维尔——论美国的民主Section 4 费迪南·滕尼斯——共同体和社会Section 5 格奥尔格·西美尔——社会组织Section 6 爱弥尔·涂尔干——社会和社会凝聚力Section 7 马克斯·韦伯——合理性和“英雄式的悲观主义”Section 8 塔尔科特·帕森斯——行动和功能Chapter 22 自然科学的新进展Section 1 爱因斯坦和现代物理学Section 2 科学分叉和技术发展——科学的应用和跨学科的进路Chapter 23 当代哲学概观Section 1 实用主义——最好在共同体内部寻求知识Section 2 逻辑实证主义——逻辑与经验主义Section 3 卡尔·波普尔和“批判理性主义”Section 4 托马斯·库恩——科学中的范式转换Section 5 路德维希·维特根斯坦——作为实践的分析哲学Sectino 6 日常语言哲学和言语行为理论——奥斯丁和塞尔Section 7 现象学和存在主义——胡塞尔和萨特Section 8 认同和承认——西蒙·德·波伏娃与女性主义哲学Chapter 24 现代性和危机Section 1 现代性之批判Section 2 马丁·海德格尔——经由诗艺Section 3 汉娜·阿伦特——积极生活(Vita Activa)Section 4 加达默尔——诠释学传统Section 5 德里达、福柯和罗蒂——解构和批判Section 6 于尔根·哈贝马斯——经由论辩]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Introduction观念的水位-刘瑜-浙江大学出版社-201301 Summary观念·此处素质公民素养的培养首先需要制度的变革打开公共空间。 民意与伪民意鉴定民意的真伪，标准在于民众在形成意见时讨论是否自由、观念可否多元、信息是否充分。 给理想一点时间相信时间，就意味着相信除了千千万万人日积月累的努力，历史没有进步的捷径。 不知道与宁可不知道“理性无知”理论：当“无知”合乎人们的“理性”时，人们可能会努力保持这种无知，刻意逃避可能会干扰这种“无知”的信息。 恶之平庸犯下恶行者，因看不到与所犯恶行相关的一系列事件的全貌，似乎都有理由觉得自己无辜。所谓人性觉醒，就是从自己所隐身的角色中抽身出来，恢复成独立、完整并需要为自己一举一动负责的人。 贵族范儿一个道理的意义不在于它能创造多少美学上的新鲜感或者提供多少智力上的游戏感，而在于它在多大程度上回应现实中的真问题。（道理的意义在于回应现实中的真问题。） 迷人的愤怒愤怒是通向正义感进而达成“存在感”的捷径。对很多掌权者而言，民众的愤怒是最好的政治兴奋剂。施密特：政治的要义是“分清敌我”。 肩负自由的疲惫民众对政府的不信任促进政府被改造得更加值得信任。民众对政府一定的信任是政府健康的表现。 告别印象主义不要印象主义。(逻辑和论据不可能说清所有社会问题，但有存在意义。) 今天您施密特了吗不要施密特中国粉丝团文风。（诉诸强力的前提是对话空间已被开拓和穷尽。） 弹性的限度解除政治悲剧应着眼于权力的结构，而不是政策的创新。 怎样推销“糖果”在现代社会里，只有决策透明、民主、科学，才合乎程序正义。 标签战标签的意义在于屏蔽而不是展开思考。标签战伤害道理的微妙性。标签战源于认知懒惰。标签战伤害公共理性。 没来的请举手知识有三种：你知道的，你不知道的，你不知道自己不知道的。保持对被遮蔽的世界的知觉。 法治何以可能权利的前提本质上是权力。法治有意义的前提是权力平衡。 他也可以是我康德:道德准则的存在基于普适性。人权观念的伦理基础是博爱。博爱的起点是自爱，自爱加同理心成为博爱。 合同异否认量变的差异，就是否认了进步的可能性和必要性。 权力的道德捆绑将道德和权力捆绑，是动员民众加入政治斗争的统治策略。 观念的水位观念水位变化的重要标志之一是以前民众眼中不是问题的问题开始变成问题了。民主的观念基础：问责意识和权利意识。 观念·别处倒霉的英国议员信息公开不能仅靠领导人的“决心”，还需要依赖媒体自由、政党角逐、权力制衡等机制来将信息公开的权力从领导人手中转移到他人手中。 提问时间到官员既无需风度也无需知识的国家里，官员的日子也许好过了，民众的日子则不一定。 过去的怎样让它过去诚恳反思过去的核心意义是在直面历史的基础上实现真正的和解与稳定。 沉默罪独立于权势的法庭应同时独立于民愤，否则无以平衡权势。 大家一起来算账政治辩论应集中于具体政策。 敲开最好的可能一个正常社会往往缺少的不是人的善意，而是引导善意流向弱势群体的中间人。政治敲开人性的可能性。 让政治变得家常政府最应做的事是提供服务。 民主的裤衩权力制衡制度的最大好处是其自我纠错机制。 吵吵更健康因为自由反哺观念的多样性，民主的质量很大程度上依赖于思想的自由。 苏东巨变：二十年之后同步性未必意味着因果性。政治转型不是直线过程。 俄罗斯的徘徊民主的存在意义基于自由。 当“革命”成为家常便饭民主制度需要民众对政治长期监督。 有亚洲特色的民主制度大于出身是民主的要义。 当民主缺失中产阶级程序正义是现代政治的根基。 历史螺旋式终结福山：自由民主制度迟早会成为人类政治文明的终结状态。 选举式独裁政治制度的健康基于制衡。只注重垂直呼应民意而忽视水平制衡的政府也许合法但不合理。 宪法这只兔子手握政权者对宪法的控制力体现政治的质量。 我们在输出什么政治和经济相互渗透，两者的发展都需考虑相互间的影响。 有多少资本主义可以重来？允许民众自由表达观念和利益的制度促成民主制度的纠错弹性。经济活力和社会凝聚力，二者不可缺一。 新自由主义的两种命运国家引进自由经济制度时，还需对政治、法律、福利政策方面改革，通过经济自由实现发展，通过政治民主保障公平。 从更人道的到更霸道的福利是个体责任，而非集体权力。 书幸福的与被幸福的当统治者的恩赐被视为民众幸福的源泉时，统治者越高大，民众越渺小。 当他们开始用脚投票行动胜于雄辩。 成圣又如何思想资源决定意识形态，意识形态决定游戏规则。 红旗未曾下过这只蛋读史，不拘泥于其中，然后反思。 那个搬起石头砸自己脚的人推动时代的更迭，需要个人的牺牲。 底线时分无底线者让人鄙夷。 超越那些“想当然”思考结果以及过程，思考他人以及自己。 当自由遭遇一丝微风言论自由是一切自由的基础。政权的言行不一致使其权力衰竭。 在黑暗中消失之前人的尊严可以不屈于黑暗。 重新发现我们自己国家与社会可以相辅相成。 法治的“秘密”法治源自权力机构的价值自觉和实践。民众的“素质”很大程度上取决于国家机构本身的“素质”。 你比你想象得更自由兰德：道德只建立在个体理性的基础上，其基础不该是任何宗教、情感、社会、国家、阶级以及任何形式的集体。 诸善之间不只“善”与“恶”，“善”之间也可构成紧张关系。 像一滴水一样高华：毛时代的思想改造“配方”-资源的垄断式供给+全面改写历史前提下的信息封闭与观念灌输+在群体中孤立个体+强力威胁；以及这种“思想改造”外科手术般的“程序”：封闭的学习文件-&gt;组织群体对个体进行批评与攻击-&gt;自我羞辱式的检查与“交心”-&gt;必要时的惩罚甚至暴力惩罚-&gt;纠编阶段受害者的感激涕零。为了过去，还原历史的本来面目。 从经典到经验经典的价值不在于他人的赞美，而在于是否能帮助你认识你所置身的世界与自己。真正的好书都向证伪敞开，而不是给你一个一劳永逸的启示。 电影愿像那水中浮木一个人占有得越多，就被占有得越多。 快乐的可能剥夺快乐的权利，或会扭曲人性。对快乐的渴望，保留挽救人性的希望。 如此优雅的平庸诗意无法拯救平庸。 没有你们就没有他们人可为趋利避害而抛弃信念。物质基础也可被上层建筑改造。 语言的贫困思想的钳制造就语言的饥荒，但语言的饥荒也恶化思想的贫困。一个政权的专制程度，总和它的词语丰富程度成反比。 爱是True love is love for humanity. 善的理由人需从生命的虚空中打捞“善”的意义。“善”不只是求生策略。 回到巴黎和你的梦想和你所想象的自己有关的，才是你的故乡。 剩下的琥珀之城保护历史遗迹。历史融入生活。严肃对待小事。尊重规则秩序。充满好奇心。 另一个高度舍去身份，追上自由。 请别让我消失人生的虚空让人恐惧。 兔子跑什么跑逃避自我，寻求爱情，但爱情不可填补自我这个深渊。 最好的时光以沉默守护青春。 诗的世界在每一个角落里等待更少地生活以便于更好地生活，减少与生活的接触面有利于在有限的面积上精耕细作。 记得当年草上飞在时间面前，我们能指望的，大约只是以生的优雅抚慰它的渺小。 在死亡的强光中可以绝望，但不要唠叨绝望。 论时尚时尚该是在一切随波逐流前逆行。 写给末日“末日”的意义在于给我们一个机会，去审视自我是否活在此时此地。 那些剩下的东西灵魂的差异间接肯定了自由意志。]]></content>

    <url>%2F2017%2F09%2F27%2F2017-09-27-Known_Proofs_You_Can_Increase_Your_Brain_Power%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Known1. Reading trains the brain.Oxford scientists proved that the process of reading trains the cognitive abilities of the brain. It also activates areas that aren’t used at other times. While reading, blood enters the brain areas responsible for concentrate and cognition. It’s noteworthy that this effect doesn’t occur when watching TV or playing computer games. 2. Painting improves the work of the brain.Painting and contemplations of works of art improve the interaction between brain areas while slowing its aging. 3. Romantic love and maternal feelings are very similar.According to brain activity, romantic relationships and maternal feelings are very similar, but there are differences as well. For example, passionate love activates the brain areas related to sexual arousal. In addition, the feeling of anxiety and fear decreases, and the feeling of euphoria increases. Maternal love activates the areas responsible for the formation of affection. 4. The abundance of sugar in the diet worsens memory and reduces the ability to learn.The abundant of fructose in the diet slows down the brain and reduces its ability to learn, remember information, and concentrate. This is because the excess sugar destroys neural connections in the brain. Scientists emphasize that industrially produced sugar is much more harmful(Add to soft drinks, seasonings, sauces, and baby food). However, products containing Omega-3 fatty acids(such as fatty fish, nuts, and fish oil) remove the consequences of the disorder. 5. Pregnancy changes the brain’s structure.Pregnancy reduces the amount of gray matter in the brain areas responsible for social cognition and the ability to understand other people. All of it is necessary to strengthen the mother-baby connection, help a woman understand the need of her child, and notice possible external dangers. 6. The brain is sensitive to dehydration.Our brain is almost 80% water. Therefore, even a moderate loss of fluid(about 2%) reduces concentration and vigilance and leads to deterioration of short-term memory and other cognitive abilities. 7. Love and hate have a lot in common.Love and hate originate in similar brain areas. However, unlike hatred, love significantly reduces the activity of the areas responsible for judgment and logical thinking. 8. Prolonged stress destroys the brain.A decrease in memory, in the ability to learn, in self-control – these are the consequences that chronic stress is fraught with.Also, it contributes to a person feeling irritation, anxiety, tension, and often being distracted. 9. Chronic lack of sleep worsens memory.During a full night’s sleep, brain cells remove toxic compounds dangerous for our brain. If a person never gets enough sleep, it has a devastating effect on their brain cells.

Hold your breath for 7 seconds. Breath out through your mouth for 8 seconds. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for four “cycles”. Hint Practice at least twice a day. To help fall asleep, practice when you get in bed or if you wake in the night. If you’re feeling stressed or feel like you need to settle your nerves, practice to get a “hit” of calm. You may feel a little light headed when you begin. It will pass as you practice. After a month you may want to extend to 8 cycles.Effects are subtle to begin but increase with repetition. It takes about 2 months of practice to get best results.]]></content>
